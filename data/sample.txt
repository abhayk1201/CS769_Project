"Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed. "
I really like this ring so I’m glad to hear that.
The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.
I like hearing about these positive encounters.
"This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao"
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!

Wow this basically means that 99%of bolliwood movies are basically documentaries! This changes everything!
Poor fella just got his arms out of plaster and we’re already making fun of him
[Did you really love the outcast cat in the photograph; editorializing is no longer permitted.
The fact [NAME] met her at the airport should tell you all you need to know about why they did it. What a farce.
"I would start laughing, screaming seems inappropriate"
This was the most fun I've had watching a game since [NAME] 35 point game

Funny looking bats.
I love how [NAME] touted the Hong Kong model as something beneficial. What a joke.

Lmao that's a funny coincidence
Good riddance. I'm surprised it lasted that long. [NAME] is trash.
I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.

I keep telling everyone to watch it. It's such a fun movie and the directing is great.
good news is his fall was cushioned by [NAME] soft hairy body

Done! Good luck!

"Oh my [NAME], this is an absolute lie. "
He must've done something real bad. I played with a guy who by all counts was an asshole but never received more than mutes.
This game and it’s updates can be very frustrating sometimes. We already discuss the issues to death but meme Monday has been oddly therapeutic
"This is embarrassing, but while purging I wear a pad or don’t wear pants at all. Eating disorders are so beautiful /s"
Feed her poetry. But in a metaphorical way not in a weird way
I don't understand why [NAME] is starting it on the feet..
"You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake."
"Actually made me feel worse. Kids are always back there, death would have been guaranteed had they any."
It's a shame that anyone has to deal with that sort of feeling. I'm sorry that you had a similar experience. No one deserves that.
So proud our sub is leaking into facebook
Says one of the two people who keeps on responding to each comment with a very poorly argued position lacking both in research and in common sense.
"This is ok as extra content, but it feels really uncomfortable."
I guess her Bad breath turned him off
PNW represent! Southern Oregon. Our non-mono scene is....pretty sparse.
That was just embarrassing. We should not be loosing here.
I'm ashamed it took me a while to get it
And look like big tracts of land.
In my mind. I forgot everything :(
Just making a joke from The Office. My bad haha
Sorry. I know I should be grateful and happy.
That arena announcer is irritating.
Lol oh shit everyone turn around
Our performance was an embarrassment and should never have happened. It's a bottom of the league style performance against top.
"Totally forgot that, my bad"
Srs that shade range is abysmal smh
"I unintentionally read this from right to left this time, probably because I recognized this meme and know that it normally is the wrong way. I fooled myself "
When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...
Middle school. Puberty was rough for most of us. I was a victim and a perpetrator of a lot of stupid behavior in middle school.
[NAME] apologized to [NAME] and [NAME] about his comments. I don’t see the “I got hacked” comment.
[NAME] looks so defeated every time [NAME] posts him up
i think people who get up in a dizzy over an add that shames bullying and sexual harassment are probably special snowflakes.
Music was better when [NAME] beat his wife
I’m just glad to finally see something truly cringy in a while
me too. it's a way of keeping distance. feels too intimate to use someone's name.
It makes customers uncomfortable because we're calling them on their BS and this is the only way to get them to own up to it.
Why? He was always brilliant. It was such a shame he lost out to [NAME]. Things would have been very different today...
The truly sad thing is she's getting burned to legitimize Russiagate. It's a shame she wasn't a legit whistleblower.
Everybody is just temporarily embarassed millionaires
It's like they are gatekeeping tiredness. So weird.
So it’s somehow weird or different to make a child/student pick up their (there) own mess as part of the lesson?
"That last bit is part of the embarrassment, actually."
"Honestly, these are probably things you should have thought about before telling your husband you wanted to separate. "
Ok. I didn't know we discussed this topic. Have a nice day.
"oops, my bad."
"I know, all the comments have me cracking up."
2 is less user friendly but it can be fun. As long as you turn chat off. And hate yourself already.
I didn't believe it until I saw a video with creepy music. CREEPY. MUSIC. That's when my eyes were opened.
I miss [NAME]. Shame he had to get injured while he was here
We’re playing the leafs. He’s gonna look bad no matter what
It’s a shame we have to face the islanders so soon
Right. Because [NAME] was a circumcized [NAME] who died for our sins.
"I always walked in the grass, man. Am I weird?"
How embarrassing.
"I know, right? I mean I liked Le Tigre, but this is just damn embarassing."
"My bad I just realized it, I’m 31M and she’s 31F"
I got that feeling as well. Hoping he retires a Jet. We are the one org that embraced him. He was coaching sam every step.
"I do this too, and it works, but I think it’s largely psychosomatic, right? "
[NAME]. They’re grasping for straws!
Sick BURN!
Hey bro there’s no judging here
I asked at the Bodies Reveled show if they used prisoner bodies.. I got an awkward no.
"LOL. The one in the bed, when [NAME] is walking in with the candle. It was just awkward. "
"My first [NAME] bio said something like ""I'm not gonna fuck any of you, so don't try""😂😂"
I totally have second-hand embarrassment for my parents. It's equally bad when they misspell something in their email address (i.e: posion instead of poison) 🙄
Seeing [NAME] score on them was unbelievable. How embarrassing!
"Damn you really need a girlfriend, dude. 🤣 "
r/iamatotalpieceofshit call the police for destruction of private property gg ez clapz
"That sums it up perfectly, but for a lot of people it's still the worst mgs... So you can tell it was very risky"
The fact that he allowed himself to be bullied and pressured means he obviously lacks the courage of his convictions and should step down
too much logic in there for remainiacs only interested in cheering for unicorns and insulting the british people.
"It's probably more like when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I'm so sick of this paranoia."
"Ugh the amount of mismanaged shame, the Olympic level gymnastics to deny deny deny....it makes my eye twitch. "
It was believable until the “almost got beat up after class” part
"I often send my female friends Love poems. Oh wait, no, no I don't, because that is super weird. "
It's a strange decision that they scheduled this to conflict with the NFL playoffs in the United States.
"Oh, it’s actually its own thing. I heard goo and just assumed the worst."
This is oddly fitting now you have to do DR2 and V3
I'm ashamed that while trying to figure out what TKE stands for all I can come up with is Tau Kappa Epsilon.
You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.
I thought he was trolling oops
"My bad on the phrasing, it’s more of a hole with a vent cover "
Kind of telling that I haven't received a response really
This website is so strange.
2. I hate to say it but it’s the same thing I do and I hate myself for it
Short and simple... More embarrassing being a janitor or being in the unemployment line?
"No, it's the curds, they just feel really strange in my mouth."
"I don’t make the rules, man, I just blindly follow them like a sheep"
"Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody.. Probably more or less amatur x'D"
Is he dead now from a tragic drowning accident? Asking for a friend.
Drunk and crying in bed with my pets. :|
that most of the fandom does not get that reference is depressing
Hugs. We put our sweet lady kitty to sleep one year ago tomorrow.
He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!
"[NAME] is a murderer,a psychopath and he wants just to kill him"
"Like they ""went for it"" against the [NAME] administration for lying the nation into war? "
"Omg, I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love. That's horrible. :/ Are you doing okay?"
The attempt was successful. He's crying and not talking to them because they're actually dead.
after that we had no sustained damage for the fight so [NAME] and [NAME] just killed [NAME]
Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.
"I love how you only see these types of comments on Japanese games, brings out the inner weep."
Wait so the aboleth only kills you if you dont do what the dm says
I feel so bad for [NAME]. It was probably hard to concentrate on this match with the things going on in his personal life
">Found out that **my** [NAME] Oh, I get it. You've caught the scent of a lesser stag in your nostrils. Pity!"
You're not really pissing anyone off. Mostly we just pity you.
One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!
You're going NOWHERE! Edit: [NAME]
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
She's passed away.
Oof I’m glad this was the top post bc I literally came here to post it after seeing it on Facebook
Fuck if I only could have those a single family home prices back :( maybe I wouldn’t be living in my RV
My one regret is not making an account sooner. I lurked for a long time because I felt like I didn't have anything worth saying.
I like how the [NAME] stood there like what the fuck and then just accepted his death.
I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn’t fall in love again. I’ve never been married.
They probably died anyways
Just learn from this and move on bro. Give yourself time to mourn.
"*Shrug* ""Heh, Another tuesday"""
"Ohthe good old lemon meme died so quickly, i mean that’s how mafia works"
Your life must be miserable. That's sad somehow
Her accent!! I died.
"Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow. "
"[NAME]! He was just amazing, best contract ever, so sad when we lost him. "
youve never played against a good support [NAME] then
"Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated."
My life has been destroyed
So sorry for your loss.
Yes used to b bad into oxys been clean from any painkiller is 5 years beside subs
What happens when a Jedi gets PTSD? Play this game to find out. Hint: ITS FUCKIN BAD NEWS SON
I kill them all and THEN overwrite my only save. I'm bonkers.

My husband died outside the church Damn Vampires
"Peta killed a dog once, so peta is bad, so veganism is bad, so its ok to kill and eat billions of animals (including dogs)"
Why am I crying alone in my room rn
I’m not crying.. You’re crying!
Soon: Mass death of pink-skinned Aussies.
Inheriting your dad's company when he dies doesn't count you spoilt piece of shit.
"[NAME] you sound like my father, I feel sorry for you"
"[NAME] will get injured after today or in the next one or two matches. Death, taxes and [NAME] injury."
"You forgot about Argentina, 30k people died here because of the USA"
It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something
"Obviously a degree in veterinary medicine, in case Mr [NAME] has the sniffles"
My father has been dead for two years and it's still been difficult to not talk about him as if he's still alive.
Warriors ruined him tho
He would die
God [NAME] can't come back fast enough. I don't know if the fans in the rest of the league realize how big his loss is
6 and he died of cancer iirc
That’s a... tough decision. That dog better be able to talk.
The lucky ones died quick
By the end I was I hysterics. Not a single reply from the wife too.
I’m sorry for your loss bro ❤️
My condolences. Lost my cat Zoey over a year ago. I still miss her like crazy. she was only 3 years old too.
You did so good for yourself though! If you had the mother you deserve she would have the sense to be proud of you. :)
An entire family gone within minutes... how absolutely heartbreaking.
I don't remember this happening
I feel genuine sorrow for your family having to be associated with a cretin such as yourself
No I’m just following your logic. To avoid pain people should die. Life is pain so people in pain should die. It’s your exact logic
"No telling I know is not eat it, I like eggs and I like cottage cheese but yuck no they can’t touch!"
ooh boy that guy went off the deep end and drowned
Omg! An attentive parent actually teaching their children to safely handle guns! The horror!
[NAME] death is just so..... senseless. Why? WHY??? The based gods have forsaken us
"The last Super Bowl Champion your dad saw was the New York Football Giants. Take solace in that. Sorry for your loss, friend."
I think you two are obligated to go to bed together now.
I’m very sorry for the loss of your friend.
She would be devastated! Whatever you're going through won't last forever... this will pass!! Ask for help - find someone to talk to!
Hardly surprising. Now they also lost their coach... rip
"Ah, this may explain all the untimely heart attack deaths we hear about for those who opposed the state or whatnot "
May he Rest In Peace.
RIP. Sad for his family and the bull riding community.
This hit way too close to home. I’m suing for emotional damage.
"Thats dope. But looks dumb when you write it. Should be, Forum 41. Or, 41st Forum or something like that."
"I'm not crying, you're crying"
My thoughts EXACTLY [NAME] looks dead.
they have died here in canada
Somebody wanted these people to burn to death.
I read on a different post that he died shortly after of internal injuries.
"[NAME] gonna end up killing her. Its just whether she does it willingly, regrettably or accidentally."
"[NAME]. Gun crimes are pretty much unheard of on that side of the pond, isn't it? RIP."
That poor mercy. Just died to die again xD
This made me cringe so hard
Wow...Mean [NAME] passed away today. RIP
"I am so terribly sorry you lost your dad to this horrendous disease. Judging by this photo, he had a terrific smile."
Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.
Someone died that day.
"I know, it got all in the poor woman’s hair!"
I'm worried he choked to death before he could finish the sentence.
"That weighs heavy on the heart, I’m so sorry for your loss"
Dude. Same. That would just be... Devastating.
"Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME]."
"She later drunkenly slipped on her puddle, fell onto the tracks, and was run over. RIP"
" Luckily from him, there is no death penalty in Brazil and the maximum a person can serve in a Brazilian jail is 20 consecutive years. "
It’s also dangerous to be riding a motorcycle waiting behind a stationary car if another car isn’t paying attention and slams into you.
Let their deaths be swift
Edited : Sorry meant to reply to a post
Very sorry for your loss.
"Lost my only grandfather two years ago to Alzheimer's, this is great news knowingly this disease sucks"
His left hand is mightily fucked.
Gatling guns hurt so much it can be like instant death with no way to react
Sad. My condolences to her family.
Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.
How incredibly dangerous
"Not on academical level, but on family and bonding and respect for people who have lost their dearest ones"
"Even today, many years later that still gives me chills. RIP."
"Oh, that's horrible. My condolences."
at least you aren't broke like me :/
Sad... RIP
Well that’s not what was said he said drugs that kill you sooner than your meant to die.. nicotine fits that description
What a bizarre way to normalize the psychological path to becoming a violent criminal.
"of course not, [NAME] and [NAME] were great friends and anyway, he's been dead since 2016."
Minimum wage hurts small business more than it helps the poor.
All sound advice. I still hate the ult when it kills me by a small hair.
"Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better."
I am so sorry to hear about your wife’s tragic injury.
hmm today i will listen to death and destruction
"I think he is dead but he died long before the supposed raid. He was old and sick, dying of kidney failure."
May you find and skin the perpetrator. My apologies to your family. ❤
I've seen pigeons do this. I thought they were injured or dead until I checked.
Wimbledon’s instagram posted about [NAME] and his relationship with the Open and I ended up crying. Not ready for him to hang it up
Had surgery at 3mnths old to fill a pinhole in my back (spinabifida) Cutting myself after some severe postpartum depression
🦀MY BABYS DEAD🦀
Na. Rediting my post. Sorry for the ignorance.
"Pity. I had some decent lunches there, but never went there at night."
Then I’m sorry but this game really isn’t for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.
"*and, sorry for the spelling mistake"
y i k e s
I've been watching too much my 600lb life...I instantly hear dr. [NAME]
"I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :("
You'll miss a begging old man asking for a spare coin. RIP
I'm sorry that's what you read because it isn't what I said.
"Sometimes, I feel bad if I don't every now and then. I mostly talk with her on SC/IG tho. "
"[NAME], too. [NAME] is very guilty of this."
Can’t fault you there
Sadly this story has died down why is he bringing it back up. Just let it die.
"“[NAME], I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything” - [NAME]"
Maybe make the lights with the towel technique and see how bad it looks
"Was referring to their government, should have specified that better. "
"Sorry, I posted this first but then you said something that I wanted to acknowledge I agreed with."
[NAME]. Im sorry
Sorry that you lost that stuff. But that's a lot to have in your car in SF
I am sorry little one
I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.
And now I regret not applying when they opened one in my town even more now. Good times.
And then attacking you as a person when you say you'd prefer not to be stalked and murdered. Sorry but your friend is a problem.
"I’m sorry if I hurt your fragile ego, you should get off the internet lol"
Self-selecting user ratings are not a reliable representation of the entire audience. They are meaningless numbers.
I recomend a Jasikevicius from Litva :) Sorry for English.
Damn sorry to hear bro. You guys still friends though?
"I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby"
I’m still sorry you had to go through that. I’m sorry anybody has to experience fear on a daily basis.
Human trafficking is bad.
"I will let my nonexistent child die, thats all right with me!"
Sorry about your poor trolling. 3/10.
You're right. Sorry for the poor reply.
You'd think we don't have anymore tears already... It's been 62 years of crying.
regret unfollowing him...
I feel like most of us were pricks as kids
The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
Ah. My misunderstanding. Yeah get rid of those but that isn't what the removed post was.
Oh sorry I didn’t realize that journalists weren’t actually autonomous humans that can think for themselves.
I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My mom does the same anytime she loses something. She accuses people of stealing whatever she lost.
"I’m sorry should I have brought my make-up wipes and washed my face during my MRI? Or my ultrasound? Find some peace, man. "
Have you told him you aren't 100% ok with it? It sounds like you're regretting this decision.
"wE mODiFieD eiGHT viDEo CaRds tO fIt iN A SinGLe pciE sLoT /squeak Whoops, sorry, wrong [NAME]."

"Apologies, I should have been more specific. Where abouts is JD? "

"So sorry, for your loss."
But what did he druer? Sorry. (Im not sorry)

"I regret not grabbing my work laptop today, then I wouldn't have to leave fort blanket until Thursday. "
I'm sorry. I meant numbers. Where can I see them.

Sorry about that!
Very true. Apologies if it came off that way.
"Sorry to hear that, brother. Why do you feel more lonely now compared to usual?"
I am so sorry! I hope you are okay!

Sorry !! You’re real good at that!!
I'm sorry to break the news to you. :(
Because I was a fan through all of those NFCCG losses...
I am so very sorry that you are dealing with all of this
You’ve seen the world.. choose your regrets
"Yeah, sorry I don't know British or Canadian."
