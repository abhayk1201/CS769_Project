Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.	1
Am I weird I don't get affected by compliments if it's coming from someone I know irl but I feel really good when internet strangers do it	2

"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.
I’m so scared I might do something drastic, I’ve been shaped by fear and anxiety. Idk what to do anymore"	1
"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

Sorry for wasting your time"	1
"[Trigger warning] Excuse for self inflicted burns*I do know the crisis line and used it after when I was having a panic attack.
*I know it's not a healthy thing to do.

But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself.  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.) He's seen my at my worst - but! I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, I'm thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts.


 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine? 

I do not want to self harm again, I just need to be able to explain this."	1

"Everyone wants to be ""edgy"" and it's making me self conscious I feel like I don't stand out. I can draw yes and play the guitar but I honestly feel like am stuck in the past, my taste in music are all rock and alt metal from
2000's to the 90's and it doesn't really make me feel unique it's just my style but seeing as my friends and classmates getting more into rap and EDM it's hard for me to feel like I fit in.
The I don't feel like I stand out is because of all the others copying a style and if I do that I'd be just another
""Quirky kid"" who's in a cringey phase.
Many of my friends say that I look good in grunge style and I kinda agree but it's hard for me to continue that if I can't even stand out from all the ""edgy
People who wore crosses and wallet chains and do tiktoks""

Really feels like I don't fit in in all categories, am scared that people might confuse me with a CLOUT CHASER or a fucking tiktok e boy goddamn
I hate my life"	2
My life is over at 20 years oldHello all. I am a 20 year old balding male. My hairline is trash and to make matters worse my head is HUGE. I have bipolar, depression and crippling social anxiety. Balding has been the cherry on top. I wear a hat 24/7 even in my room when I’m alone because I can’t stop thinking about it. I pop Xanax all day to try and numb the pain and it works for a little bit but it all comes crashing back twice as hard once I come down. I don’t know how to communicate with people anymore and I don’t know how to keep a relationship. I used to be one of the “popular kids” but after my dad passed away I feel into a deep dark hole. I’ve been arrested numerous times, been in rehab, mental hospitals, you name it. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didn’t have them I’d be dead long ago. But it’s getting to the point where even their love and support isn’t going to be enough to keep me alive anymore. I’m either going to be the guy who killed himself, or the guy who went bald and 20 and looks like a child molestor. Which one would you choose?	1
I took the rest of my sleeping pills and my painkillersI can’t wait for it to end, I’ve struggled for the past 6 years and I’m finally ending it.	1
"Can you imagine getting old? Me neither.Wrinkles, weight gain, hair loss, messed up teeth and bones, health issues, menopause, hormones, hating new generations &amp; the way world progress.

Can you even imagine yourself there? Absolutely not. Even if I was happy, I'd take my life just to avoid this. "	1
Do you think getting hit by a train would be painful?Guns are hard to come by in my country but trains are not. I just don't want to suffer though, do you think this would be a painless method of suicide?	1
"death, continuedI posted here before and saw something interesting.  I asked for information.  You know what I got back?  A bunch of people who wanted to do the same thing to me as they always do: spit back personal information about me.  This makes things worse, obviously, but at least a bunch of trolls are having laughs.

In the end, my desire to self-terminate grows stronger.  I have so little left now, but still have the same bitterness, just a bit stronger now.  The main goal throughout the process is to minimize the subsequent fallout.  It would certainly have been nice had the patrons of this forum been more respectful of my privacy, but that was obviously a bit of a ridiculous expectation, considering the source."	1

"I’m scared.   Everything just seems to be getting worse and worse. I’m young and I think I’m transgender but I’m not even sure about that. I can’t tell if I’m just lying to myself or if I’m actually trans, I feel so overwhelmed with thoughts and emotions and I can’t just take it anymore.
    I just wish I could at least know for sure if I was trans, and even then I have to worry about if my (religious) family will be accepting and if I can actually do anything to alleviate my pain a bit.
   I cut myself for the first time yesterday, I barely even drew blood so I can’t even fucking hurt myself correctly. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to do anything correctly, I want to pursue music but I know there’s no money to be found in that field unless I become famous but that’s not happening. 
   Currently I’m not seriously debating suicide but the thoughts keep coming back and they just keep getting worse. I’m not sure if I can really take this much longer, I just wish I was born a girl. I want to cry."	1

"I am ending my life today, goodbye everyone.I am 36 almost 37, I am on disability for PTSD and Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am 400 lbs and sick of living. I am tired of being single and rejected and made to feel as if I was some kind of monster. I am tired of not having anyone to connect with, to connect too, to have a companionship with. I am tired of being alone and single in this world, all because of my weight. 

This loneliness has taken too much of me, it has swallowed me up from the inside out. It has consumed me. I see nothing but darkness everywhere I look. I see nothing but hate towards me everywhere I look. I have absolutely no one in my life. and this loneliness reminds me of it every day. 

I am done with this world and ending my life today so goodbye everyone, by the time anyone reads this I will be dead. "	1

"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she’s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don’t blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn’t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don’t have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can’t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

Goodbye,

"Posting Galadriel’s opening monologue every day until I get a girlfriend Day 3 Galadriel: (speaking partly in Elvish)

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all."	2

I feel like I am drowningI used to go to school at a state university, then I had to drop out for financial issues. It's been a year since then and I haven't moved anywhere in my life. I have one job (15 hours a week, so I don't make enough money for essentials like food, soap, toothpaste, etc..) and I am trying to find another job but I can't find one. I feel like I'm going to be stuck in this hole forever and  part of me just wants everything to be over. I apply to 5-6 jobs a day and make sure to call back but all I get is an explanation as to why they don't need me. I also haven't been able to afford a haircut for 3 months and I'm self-conscious about it because my hair never gets long and it feels gross. I spent all of this month with my bank account overdrafted and I have no clue how I will pay rent. Sorry for rambling, but I can't stop thinking of killing myself and I really want help.	1

"revenge suicideDoes the thought ever cross your mind? Do you ever alone, isolated, uncared for? Do you feel like youve reached out over, and over, and over, and yet no one hears you or takes you seriously? Do you ever feel like everyone in your life has given up on you?

I feel like jumping off this roof right now is the only way anyone will ever notice, or care, about how much pain I feel.

I may be dead, I may never be here to see it, butpeople will finally care. Peop'e will finally notice my pain. And itll be okay, because ill be dead, and because there wont be any more pain. there wont be any more anything. and thats really really okay.

im a coward. im an enormou fucking coward. but im sitting up here, on this roof, slowly dosing up on medication. i hope that if i wIt long enough, if i take enough ativan, i wont be coherent enough to feel fear, or regret, or second thoughts. ill be dead near instanstly when i jump. Its finally gokng to be over, and I feel so happy"	1

"I thought I had got past these thoughts....This might sound weird but my Dad passed away quite suddenly two months ago. I did get to talk to him before he died but it still hurts. I had been quite suicidal prior to my dad's passing but for a month after those thoughts hardly entered my mind. But now they seem to be the only thing that occupies my mind. I been trying to deal with my depression with therapy and meds but I don't think they are really working. 

This all came to the forefront since I quit my job to start a business with two friends but everyday I feel like we made a huge mistake and we are going to lose everything. The business is puttering along but it has not taken off enough to pay us a wage. Every month I juggle figures and hope we have enough money and credit to pay our bills.

I hate being the boss, I wish I had never quit my job. Sure you deal with the crap managers give you but at the end of the day you can go home and switch off, unlike now where all I do day after day is worry about losing our home.

I really wish I could go back in time and undo this decision. If some one presented my with a button that said it would kill me in my sleep in 24 hrs I would push it and be thankful."	1

That may sound pathetic but even though it was quarantine and it’s not a good idea to start a relationship during quarantine and probably wouldn’t but it was still nice to have someone to think about.

"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
Why do I want to kill myself?
It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.

**Economic**:

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living."	1
What the fuck?? I finally had the confidence to go meet someone in real life again, I was really excited to see my only real life friend and we would just walk around in the city and shop a bit. A few days ago my mum forced me to go on an activity I absolutely hate, my parents always force me to du stuff I really don't wanna do. Well it turns out on that free time activity I went to, which I absolutely hated, I talked to no one and just stayed away from everybody. Someone MAYBE has covid so now I can't go to the city and I will miss the first two days of irl schools which would have given me a plan on how this school year starts. Great! Now I cried for the past two hours, I was in a really good mood. I was really looking forward to get my school life together and I built up the confidence and now I feel even worse than before and I fucking hate it.	2
"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it."	1

"I feel so hopelessHello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5
Years no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind. I just want the pain to end, I just want to not be alone, and want someone to hug me and tell me I’m valid."	1
Just want people to know what’s happening in my life since I can’t really tell someone irl without them freaking out or something.I really don’t want to, but stuff is going to happen soon resulting in me loosing my family, school, and my long term girlfriend. I’m really scared, im a coward, and honestly would rather be dead than try fix this mess. Mess is putting it lightly though. If my life was a large puzzle, it’d be like just throwing the entire thing in a fire of shame. I’m thinking about just cutting an artery, but idt I’d have the stomach for that, but I’ll figure something out. I hear it takes a while to bleed out, If you don’t hit an artery, so people are usually discovered and saved. Fortunately, I live alone in a dorm room and no one ever visits so I have a lot of time. I wrote a note in class addressed to my girlfriend. Looking back at it, it’s kinda all over the place, but I don’t feel like fixing it. I hear if you slit your arm it can cause permanent damage if you fuck up, so I got some medical stuff just in case I wake up and decide not to try again right after. I guess I’m writing this here to make sure people know. I don’t have a history of depression, and haven’t really shown any obvious reasons for something to think I’d ever kill myself. I feel a certain sense of control and calmness and I’m actually looking forward to the time I have to make the decision. If I decide to go through with it, I’ll let you guys know. 	1

Constantly frowning and pissed off at everything, experiencing multiple, very frequent instances of ""l'appel du vide"" (the call of the void), and just filled with this horrid sense of dread and unease at everything. I wake up, every morning, cursing myself for not dying in my sleep the night before. I just want it all to stop."	1

"No matter how many times “it gets better”, I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and I’m ready to lie in it.I’m 26 now, have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my 12 year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment. It’s gotten better, but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time. The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead, mourning me and my choices, is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations. Today has particularly been a rocky day though, and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening.

I started having ugly thoughts tonight, like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash. Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out. I’m actually embarrassed to admit this, but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires, it scares me.

For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I don’t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and I’m getting restless.

No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but I’m wondering who’s battle is this actually? I’m definitely not fighting for myself anymore. I’ve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time."	1

Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.

Thanks for listening anyway, helped to type that out.

**Edit:**  To clarify, I am talking about real, actual mental health help - or perhaps medication - not reading self help books, not going for a run, not meditating.  I have done all of those things ad nauseum.  I do them regularly.  I try to fill my life with as much of the ""positive lifestyle"" kind of stuff as I possibly can, but it's not working.  I've read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond.  Respectfully, please understand that telling me to just jog it off isn't going to help.  I work out daily.  I am meticulous about trying to eat healthy.  I don't drink like a fish anymore.  I need real help and I don't know what to do."	1
"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?

"I want to do it but even finding a way to do this is difficult. This is the plan that I've come up with so far.Will it work? I don't want to stay alive but be disabled. I want this to work. Where I live, it's very hard for me to find a way to end my life without causing me too much pain.

Here's what I want to do:

I'll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up. I'll overdose on short acting and long acting insulin, and I'll take over 1g of propranolol, and maybe an antiemetic so I don't vomit the drug. I'll stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousness.

I'm 24 and I am a pharmacy student. The place where I live and my social skills - or lack thereof - don't allow me to get my hands on opioids, or other ways of dying peacefully. 

I'm not here to talk about why I want this. I know many of you know the feeling.

I just don't want to do it and fail and have to face family after that, or live with permanent brain damage. Please message me if comments are not allowed. I hope this is not against the rules."	1
I can't go on anymore.I've recently had suffered a psychotic episode (first and only one yet) and I have hurt the person I cared about the most. Life has lost it's meaning and I don't see any way things could get better. I have no future and can't shake the feeling that it was simply taken from me (probably projecting or putting the blame on other because I'm a fucking coward and can't take responsibility for my actions). I probably deserved it 'cause I'm a shit human and I can't change. Too much of a coward to kill myself and I will probably start starving myself soon. Don't upvote. Sorry for the bad english, it's a second language.	1

"Shopping IS AWFUL Finally was allowed to go out to London, a place other than trees and forests (I’ve only been on picnics for 5 months)

And I have to say... shopping is terrible.. before you walk in, there’s these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in, and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning.

Then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you (also very uncomfortable), you can’t actually touch any beauty products, like perfume etc... (why would I go shopping if I can’t touch or try anything on?)

I had the same experience at every other shop, and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask... it was not a pleasant experience.

I don’t think I want to go back to shopping ever again if that’s how uncomfortable it’s going to be, I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores, the future will be completely online, and social distanced... and it’s scary.

Anyways, I don’t think anyone would care enough to read about what I did today, but if you did, what do you think the future will look like?😂"	2

"2929


That’s the oldest I’ve ever been. It’s the oldest I’m ever meant to be.


I don’t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn’t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real… Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you’re lying in bed wondering.


“Did I just wake up… or just fall asleep.”


The fragments don’t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, I’ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I’m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn’t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I’ve cousins who experience the same. We’ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn’t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


I’ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn’t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can’t say for certain why I chose 27… Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I’m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I’ve always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I’d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I’m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who’s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It’s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I’m far from being a master at this myself.


“Why don’t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?”


Is it because that’s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive… Does the family’s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we aren’t clairvoyant. Odds are it’s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I’ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29… am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don’t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I’m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I don’t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can’t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


“How would she react?”


“What would the funeral look like?”


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages… Likely never settling back down into their original position.


That’s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I’ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I’ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others’ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I’m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe… Just maybe 29 isn’t the end… It’s just a new beginning.

"Friend has been suicidal, not sure what to doHi all, I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this but I'm at a loss on what to do. My friend from high school has been showing signs of attempted suicide. We don't talk as much ever since I moved away for college but her social media posts as well as someone she is close to messaged me their concern at well. I've tried texting her but she has been ignoring my messages and it's gotten to the point where we're really afraid she's going to do it. She currently lives with her father but I haven't been able to get in contact with him. I'm not sure what else to do.

"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it."	1

"I want to cry, god fucking damnit I want to cry. Growing up being ridiculed for crying, being bullied for it, I've stopped. I don't know exactly when it stopped, but I just didn't cry anymore.

Maybe it's because I don't have an outlet to confide in. Maybe I just need someone to talk to. But guess what? I can't. I can't talk about my problems to someone I know. What if they think I'm pathetic? What if they think I'm weird? What if they think I'm weak? I don't want to be seen as such, so I've refrained. But it's been so fucking long since I've cried my heart out. My heart has cracked, but nothing is escaping. I constantly feel sad, on the verge of a breakdown. But just when I think it's finally going to happen, I'm finally going to release my pent up stress and feelings, I stop myself. 

I haven't been able to go on and cry, get emotional, get real. I'm so fucking done with this. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them. I have people I know I can trust, but for some reason I don't trust them. Maybe it's because I know that at any moment they can betray me. Reveal all of my problems to someone I don't even know.

Point is, crying is important. If you ever start crying, cry your fucking heart out. Trust me, you'll need it."	2
"I'm convinced my math teacher hates me I've been struggling with math and it's tough for.me my teacher knows that but still gets mad when I can't  get the answer to a question and embarrass me in the middle of class. Then there are my grades I had a c in math and progress reports where going out you only get one if you have a d grade or lower but my teacher gave one to me. And ingot in trouble because my parents expect at least a b. Then last week we had a test. I was getting my grades up I was almost to a b but then I notice I see a day later my grade went down by almost 30 points. And  I thought I did well I knew for a fact I passed that test. I double checked my answers triple checked I had to have at least got most right. But then I see I have an f now. The test wasn't even 30 points. Now I'm screwed the quarters almost over and the home work which is most of our grade is only Worth one point IF my teacher grades it sometimes he ""forgets"" so it's pretty much impossible to get your grade up. And his response to asking about my grade is do your work. Pretending I don't turn in all of my work on time. I'm so stressed out 8th grade sucks I hate it. Everyone's mean and distant the more I grow up and my grades can't stay up. I'm going to fucking implode."	2
"no rewards for resistensehi reddit. i am an anon. i do not know why i am postting this reaaly. perhaps a chance to hear myself speak? perhaps an open forum to categorise my thoughtS? perhaps just because... and because is enough.

ten years ago i gave up on life. i crossed a lne.

it's not despair or depression that keep me beyond that line. it is fatigue.

a member of my family was suisidal. to my knowledge they still are. we don not speak about it. we are unable to now.

i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.

they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.

three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?

their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.

eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.

i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.

we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.

i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.

that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.

they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.

we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.

they did not die.

years pass.

i move on.

they move on.

that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.

time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.

while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.

god it's such a struggle.

that memory of surrender haunts me.

but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.

so i weather.

i endure.

i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.

i no longer know how to handle compliments.

my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.

i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.

and i never feel satisfaction.

that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.

that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.

i'm so tired.

and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.

""you should feel pride""

""take some credit""

and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""

i feel worthless when that happens.

so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.

i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.

i fake it.

i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.

when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.

where no one will be dragged in to my void.

where no one will watch me dead on the inside.

where no one will offer pity.

no shame.

no being locked in like i once was."	1
"At this point I'm convinced relationships just don't exist Like, how can they??

How can someone have a best friend, someone who loves them and cares about them, who ALSO does sexual stuff all while making each other happy like that. 

All the more convinced my life is a lie and everyone is a paid actor"	2
"I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI've graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I'd got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams. I've graduated with 3.2/4 gpa score. I've gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme, I've played in a great band for the first 3 years of my university life, had been selpt with 5-6 women which I had a serious relationship that last 2.5 years with 2 of them. I've graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies. My first ever game had got downloaded by 2 million people during my first job experience. This year at 14th Februrary, everything was changed. My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy, my parents got divorced (and they were very verbal to me about this topic), I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries (totally different industry that I'd imagine for my career). I dont know, I think I've accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better. 

I could do better if I was living in a different country, I could do better if I didn't waste my time on two long serious relationships. I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent's offer to pay for it (I didn't want to make them pay for MY education). I could do better if I didn't have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme. I could do better if I didn't stop making music or writing poems and stories, I could do better if I didn't take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey. Everything I did seems like a failure to me. And worst of all, I've gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is on the ground, I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything.

Anyways, for people around me, I am a succesfull, mature, intellectual, functioning person with interesting hobbies. But inside of my mind, these things just doesn't matter. I was so pumped by my parents, my friends and my girlfriends, nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills (social, artistic, general etc.). 

I dont add value to anyone around me. Noone needs me, Noone craves for my love, needs my support, needs me around them. 

I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers. But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them. I can not seem to get laid nowadays, if you exclude some of my ex gf's. that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life (and boy, it was great). I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to. I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions. I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I'm an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. 

Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe ""highly cultural"" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn't give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. 

Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn't and I am not confident the way I express myself. 

This life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don't know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I've sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don't know.

Death, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I've been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn't feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn't care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn't be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn't care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable. "	1
it's so calming and fun ain't it just playing assassins creed 4 black flag and sailing in the sea with a shanty playing and avoiding all the fights you can avoid and just feel like a real sailor in the 1700s is so calming yet so fun at the same time	2
aight its settled im getting a stainless steel chain then i can wear my Dagaz rune on it which will be super cool. Sidenote i dont actually believe the runes have any magical power its just symbolic for me since its the rune of perseverance and ive been through a lot.	2

"i don't understand why i'm not good enough.I know there are a lot of people in this subreddit who are in impossibly hard situations and I feel like my problem is so small in comparison. However, it is one that is weighing on me and I feel so low that I want to die. I'm a 30 year old woman and have never been ""lucky"" when it comes to dating or relations, however I met someone last year that I felt I connected with. We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we ""dated"" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don't try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways. I feel like a fucking idiot for putting myself in this position but I don't see any hope."	1

Feeling alone with my suicidal feelingsMy suicidal thoughts are slowly eating away at me. They never stop. I feel trapped. I feel scared and I feel alone	1
"Not depressed or sad but getting more comfortable with suicide day by day because I just dont enjoy the struggle of being alive. 

I really don't know what i'm doing with my life. I'm 25 years old and i'm a filmmaker, people praise me for the stuff I make, write and work on but the more they do, the more uncomfortable I get. I have no real friends and no family, everybody in my life seems like an asset to my own succes, I can't help it and it sucks...... 

I got kicked out at 16 and became homeless pretty quick, since then it seems I have become desensitized to life itself, i'm actually doing really great now but still.... I'm slowly becoming an alcoholic after having been an stoner for over three years. Lately I have been thinking about getting a gun or making an exit bag and just ending it, I mean why not? Life is good-ish, i'm happy most of the time, why should I endure another 40-50 years of uncertainty and struggle while I can just end it now?  "	1
.Fuckin a man. Why is it there isn’t a single fucking troll in this whole forum. I just need a push please	1
It doesn’t get better.I tried to kill myself three nights ago and only just woke up today. I’ve had outpourings of support from family and friends but it all seems meaningless to me, like I don’t want to stay alive without being someone else’s reason to live. All I can think about is getting out of the hospital so that I can try to kill myself again and not be so foolish to call the ambulance and let myself pass out to obvliion. The thing is, if I’d have died I would’ve been at peace, I wouldn’t have known a thing more. It wouldn’t have mattered in the grand scheme of things look how many of us there are. I’m just sick of this place and sick of this cruel world with no hope or release or cool down it’s just full on  to the point where I’m not strong enough to take it and that’s okay. Sorry that I let all my family and friends down but they just don’t get it.	1

"What a wonderful feeling being drunk can beWhat a wonderful feeling being drunk can be. The softness of wine and the cradle of depression. Its the feeling that this is as good as it will get. The rest is just wishful thinking. If only. if Only they could forget about me. If only they had others to love and forgot me. I could be alone and finally go to sleep once and for all.

It’s 3:50 am, and I am seriously contemplating suicide.Hey Reddit, I’m sure the post will get completely lost in the threads but I’m sitting here with a bottle of pills trying to come up with the best way to kill myself. Today I was slapped with realization that I have unfortunately surrounded myself with terrible terrible people. People who have lied to me, gossiped about me consistently and who have been downright fake. I’m currently in college and have been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 4 years or so. I’ve attempted suicide twice, and I haven’t been successful. Part of me really wants to talk to someone but I’m to vulnerable and I don’t want to waste peoples time and I don’t want to be labeled as “dramatic”. I’m deciding if I want to write my “friends” and family letters. I’m scared that if I fail this attempt I will be so judged and hated. None of this makes sense I feel as my eyes are blurry. But reddit if you’re out there, if anyone’s out there I’m begging one last time for help before I Down this bottle of pills and climb to the top of my apartment building and succeed in finding some fucked up version of piece. I feel unloved, betrayed and downright worthless. But enough about me. This is where my story ends.	1
"here's my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I'm having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences, so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit, (it's not too good rn)

most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

My current plan is to take enough melatonin and sedatives to knock myself out, then go outside in the snow during the night wearing shorts and a t-shirt and sleep there, and hopefully the subzero cold kills me before I wake up in the morning. Would this be effective?"	1

I just feel like crying, for no reason. I was just minding my business when, my mom asked me something (that doesn't really matter to me anyway) and, I just... felt like it. I managed to go to my room without anyone noticing and... I'm just seating here now. Trying to get this out of me.

"my boyfriend is getting his wisdom teeth removed today so i wanted to make a cute post just raving about him and hopes he sees it but i doubt he will :) Well, he's asleep right now cause he hasn't replied to my messages but he deserves the rest, he'll be sleepy all day. 

Anyway...

He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop. I'm currently working on a song for him, It's been a really long writing process but I think it's coming along well. Anyway, thanks for reading that whole long winded thing, :)"	2

"I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to.

I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties. We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he’s doing better but I’ve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe I’ll do minimal contact once he’s feeling better.. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but it’s gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know it’s my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. It’s hard making friends and I don’t want to bother my friends down here. 

I had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. It’s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.

I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn’t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. I’m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. 

Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they’re english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said “what do you want me to do?! Did y’all call them like i told you?” they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn’t answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn’t answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn’t tell us to call them whenever they aren’t there if we need help if they don’t want to help. So what’s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can’t help them and to please go away.

I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasn’t meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until I’m tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I don’t know when I’ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. I’m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I don’t want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn’t attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and I’m wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe I’m overthinking. 

So now I’m thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I don’t even know how to have a self care and love day. I’m just too scared to go to work :( I don’t know if anyone would even care to read this. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone wants to talk, I’d be so happy to..."	1

"multiple half assed suicide attempts since elementary schoolnot sure how much i actually intend to say here but i've been suicidal for as long as i can remember, i think my first attempt was around age 7 and suicidal thoughts have been a constant in my life since then, from age 7 to 18 i've tried to kill myself a few times with no success and struggled with self harm in between that, i got close to trying again until i just lost all motivation to even do it and resorted to staring at the floor after realizing i would fuck up like the past few times, i was planning on just going out to a field near my house and jamming a knife into my stomach 

probably badly worded but whatever i'm just incredibly frustrated especially after years of being denied help, medical malpractice, and other bullshit pushing me closer and closer to killing myself, all while being kept alive for other people's sake"	1

"Planning to kill myself at 29hey guys

let me start by a brief intro

im 14 and live in canada. i have shitty fucking parents and i have no life

my life is a repetition of study 24/7 then piano 24/7 and secretly game 24/7 (yes im asian, korean to be exact), swim 24/7 and read boring ass classic books 24/7

so my teenage years are looking like theyre gonna get fucked and i dont think i can handle me getting old as well

so i thought of this brilliant idea that if i dont want to get old, ill just kill myself

before all this, i always thought that death was interesting. i read a lot of articles about death and read philosophical korean manga about death.

im curious to what happens to 'me' after death.

i dont think this curiosity and this low key depression will go away

so ill just enjoy my life till late 20s then just kill myself. 

any1 with me or have any opinions?

I just wanna talk to people"	1

Am I in the wrong? I have to share a room with my older brother. He always kicks me out of my own room so then I have to spend every moment with my sister who is 4 years younger then me. I have to constantly be with her, and do whatever she wants, I even have to sleep on the floor in her room. My brother was gone tonight so I just wanted to spend the night by myself playing video games. So I tell my sister I’ll sit with you until you fall asleep. She starts saying I want to sleep in your room and I say no. Then my mom starts screaming at me that I’m terrible for making her feel bad. Am I in the wrong?	2

"Just When I Think I'm In The Clear...I was so sure I was over this.  But, goodness, this new bout I slammed into is, by far, the worst I've felt in a long time.  I understand we're all trapped in our own heads, but I've never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful, sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days.  I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I'm not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often.  At all.  So when I do, and I know I'm not doing well, it feels like I'm missing an incredibly important game changer for my life.  Yet, here I am again.  Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything.  And this one going wrong is just another lump.  Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me.  Another nail in the coffin, as it were.

And it's not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior.  I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties.  And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I'm an idiot.  And a creep.  Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like ""a little brother"" to her.  Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me?  I'm just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy.  The past two nights, I'd go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with.  It upsets my friends who were drinking with me.  They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too.  Who can blame them?  It's terrible.  And the more I think about it, the worse I get.  And the worse I get, the more I think about it.  My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete.  All of this boils down to one question - ""Am I ever gonna be good enough?""  It just doesn't seem like the case.  Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way, I don't know how to handle it.  I've failed to adapt to society and the world.

Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though - probably mostly thanks to biology, but I've been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers.  This is nobody's fault but mine, I know that.  I just don't want to hurt anyone.  I'd rather not put my parents through losing another child.  But, once I've got a safe enough distance between my family and me, I may genuinely consider checking out.  It's definitely become a legitimate, daily consideration again."	1
I'm tired of convincing myself that i want to be alive every day.  if I have to do this every day for the rest of my life, then i'd like to just stop.suggestions?	1
"Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast/presence? Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television?

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. I’m sharing an observation and this isn’t an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and that’s fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldn’t usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. I’ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are “normal” (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 

Maybe I’m reading too far into it but it’s just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. It’s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it’s convenient to show that you support an agenda."	2
I have a weird question Hmmmmm… how do I shave my butt hole/ass crack?	2
I really have no way outI just can't keep living this life. I want it to end but there are too many reasons that make me need to stay here. I can't live a day without feeling remorse towards my parents, who see their son like that, same with my little brother and sister, i don't want them to be traumatized and become depressive themselves because of me killing myself. I have one precious friend, a girl that really does everything to help me, and it makes me sad to know that it will hurt her at the end. My faith in God is telling me to keep going but it's been a lifetime that i've been doing it, and i think i've reached my limit. I can't feel any form of happiness or enjoyment that make me forget about my problems, i also feel guilty about all of this, that i live an easy life, in a peaceful country, that i have something to eat and to dress with, a roof to go under but with everything life granted me i still can't appreciate it. I feel like shit. It's litterally impossible for me to kill myself because of everything i said, my life doesn't only have an impact on myself so i'm trapped in this life and it's going to be like that until i die.

"I need inputLast time I am asking for help. I don't want to be told anything else. 
Is there ANY apps or programs that will trigger a phone call and said time that's reliable.
I'm planning suicide by partial hanging however I want to be a organ donner. Ambulance response time is less than 3 minutes upon 911 getting a notification. I need 15 minutes... I want adequate time for my organs to be harvested at the very least but I need suffient time where my brain won't be getting oxygen and or blood for at least 15 minutes. (At least by then I will be brain dead). 

And also I can't have a person call 911 because: 
A) You could notify 911 earlier thus causing my plan to fall apart.
B) You would be the subject to a criminal investigation relating to my death. So it has to be automated call or program/software.

"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same

I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention. 

By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. 

From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. 

It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.

I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.

A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.

Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.

I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.

And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.

I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do. 

Does anyone else feel the same?"	2

"The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. 

So, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. 

So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. 

No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable. 

It's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close. The despair makes you unable to do anything, but the calmness let's you have the energy to end it. Thanks for reading, I appreciate you taking the time. "	1
"can't shake the suicidal ideationi've struggled on and off with depression for my whole adolescence, and have managed to cope the last 6 years without medication and the last 3 without therapy. it's been important to me to give off the air of being well-adjusted. i'm a good student at a good university, with good friends and good hobbies. 

still, i've never been able to completely move on from thinking about suicide: in the best of times, it's distant and amusing-to-think-about, in the worst it's a seriously-considered recourse. i just can't seem to feel fulfilled by any of my relationships, any of my accomplishments. even though i imagine by most accounts i'd be considered a happy, sociable, well-liked person, i feel like i just want to tie up my responsibilities, distribute my things, and get lost. almost unconsciously, i imagine the feeling of the barrel of a gun on the roof of my mouth, or what it would feel like to jump off a bridge or jump into traffic. 

it's totally humiliating."	1

"Police Visit UKThrowaway due to obvious reasons.

Last night I made a decision to significantly harm myself with the intention to end my life.
As a last ditch attempt I text Crisis Text Line.

After some back and for I had calmed down and decided to get out of the house. I left everything including my phone.

Once I managed to recoup my thoughts I gathers my things (including my phone) and went to my parents.

In the meantime, Crisis has contacted the Police and they tracked me to my parents house. This led to an encounter where I had to discuss everything in an open dialogue and I was strongly advised to stay at my parents etc.

I’m concerned with what the repercussions are now with Police (including my police records, contact with my GP/medical records and employer)."	1
"I'm fucked. All of this is an illusion.Ive recently lost someone i felt like was a brother to me, and i realized that he was one of the only people who actually wanted to spend time with me and made an effort to. 
Im so tired of being the friend who asks. 
Why are people constantly so selfish? 
Last night i tried to end everything.
it didnt work and honestly the only person who knew and ""cared"" has left me completely alone the whole day, not talking to me at all and then promises to fix things when i ask for them to do something about it, but they never do.
its probably stupid but theyre in a band, and they have always said to me ""you could be the singer, or the pianist (i play piano) or the bass player"" and all three of those have been taken and i feel like a fucking failure. 

I used to be such a bad friend. but now km getting what i deserve in life.
It just keeps happening and im so tired of this cycle. 
I got kicked out of my therapy even after i begged to stay in. 
I havent been one day clean.
When will it end?"	1
Considering killing myself, the depression just keeps strangling me.I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, since i was a little kid i've been this way. This winter my abusive girlfriend left me and i still can't get over her completely. The weekenid i had now was the best in such a long time, the issue is that i met a girl and i felt attracted to her, she's too young tho, only 18 and i'm in my late 20s and i feel shame for that. Nothing happened between us, we barely spoke but we were in the same company over the weekend and i had a great time but now the weekend is over and same old shit week after week continues. It's like a post-great-weekend-depression on top of my regular depression that i somewhat can hande most days. I hate that i can't have fun without going into deeper depressions afterwards, i don't know why that happens and yeah, feeling this attraction to a 18 year old girl is shit aswell.	1

Never EndingI’ve been going through shit this past year. My mental health has plummeted these past months and I’ve been fantasizing about self-harming all year. My oldest sister has been going at it with my mother and they sometimes get into heated arguments. My sister referenced her wanting to end it all after a fight with her boyfriend but the only thing my mother &amp; father said was that people go to Hell if they do that. That’s the only thing that matters to them. For me, the road to Heaven is already ruined because of my sexuality. If I’m going there anyway, what’s the point of waiting? This isn’t the first time she referenced this before. My mother has seen me look depressed and thought it would be best to tell me that if I commit suicide, I will burn it Hell. I was to self-destruct. I see why people take drugs. I need to feel. Dreaming about slitting my wrists only soothes me for so long. I can’t wait to get away. 21 years of living and no one has ever loved me. I’m a worthless closeted homo and I feel that world is laughing at me. I will finally get the last laugh once I hang myself. Didn’t want to ruin Christmas but now since Christmas is over, I have nothing holding me back. My depression has turn into anger. Most days, I feel rage and isolation. Nothing really brings me joy in this life.	1
I can’t upload an image so I can’t explain how much I hate YouTube’s new like, dislike and reply symbols on the comments with a meme so I’ll use a rant. Seriously, the old ones were incredibly iconic and pleasing to look at, as well as the nice blue differing much from the white and the black so you could easily see which comments you’ve liked (and disliked but nobody does that). But now they look super sharp and cramped and generally unpleasant for the eyes. As well as that, they also turn white, black if you use light mode,I’m guessing. You now have to look at them for a second to see if you’ve already liked or disliked the comment. How does nobody else know about this?!	2
"Despite what we will tell you Californians do have an accent Mine is basically standard American, but that’s cuz I was basically forced into a standard American accent cuz my family would correct me if I spoke in anything but that, so my accent is distinct from most people around me, although that’s relatively common, but most peoples accent where I live sounds like if a NorCal accent had a slight southern drawl and had the speed and stressing of a valley gurl accent, it’s bazaar and so easy to understand, although the people that stray more towards the valley gurl side are a bit harder to understand 

I do still have a central California accent but it’s not nearly as thick as most people’s, they didn’t completely beat (not literally) it out of me"	2

"I feel like my girlfriend is pulling me downHi, I’ve been a long time lurker and finally convinced myself to post something too.

So, for start, I’m a 17 year old boy from Chech Republic. I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 3 years now, but I’ve never hurt myself. But since 6 months ago, when I met my new girlfriend, I feel like I’m too obsessed with her to the point where I started choking or even cutting myself when I felt like she was mad at me.

I have pretty fragile psyche so this shit can really put me on my knees. It happens daily. It got to the point where she almost broke up with me. But I knew that if she would leave me, I would have no other purpose in life. I don’t know if I’m just too optimistic, but the only future I can see is with her. I have no friends, my family treats my like shit but she doesn’t. It’s just my mind putting me in a state where I think she treats me like shit because I deserve it so I deserve to suffer.

Is this a healthy relationship? I know that if we ever break up I’m going to kill myself, but I want to change, I want to be the best she can ever have, but I don’t know why."	1

First times thinking about suicide recentlyBeen on antidepressants for half a year now - things have only gotten worse since taking them. Recently started thinking about what the repercussions of suicide would be, and what would happen after i die. How would I do it? What’s the quickest, most efficient way that’s least painful? I don’t even wanna act like I’ve got some huge sob story and my life has been doomed from the start. I’m just sick of hating myself and wanting to be somebody else. I’m tired of waking up and wanting to go back to sleep, even though I’m not tired. I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while. I wanna just stop existing for a little while. I’m so burnt out. Not even from school. I’m burnt out from life. The nice thing about it all, though, is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore. I’m about to graduate high school and go to my dream college, and all I can help but think about is how much I don’t care about my future anymore. I don’t care about the consequences of my life anymore. It’s nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself. Now when I screw things up, instead of feeling like crap, and just think about how it won’t matter in the long run since there won’t be a long run. A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore, so my fuck-ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain.	1
"The Dispair Islands and its residents The Void Islands are a group of Islands located on the surface of an almost dead dimension. The Islands are likely alive and they demonstrate their lives by changing position and shape every 279 years. The Island is inhabited by a tribe of natives called ""the Wave Missionaries. In 1478 DC another group of humans came to the islands and pillaged most of them, in 1480 began a war  between the Wave Missionaries and the aggressors.  The Missionaries were led by Hato, the best swordsman in all the Islands, who was gifted by the Wave a set of divine powers. The aggressors came from a never specified location and were led by Irwin Wardlock. The war ended in 1487 after the fall of Fort Hijo. After that Hato decided to pass down his powers to his family. In 1501 he mysteriously disappeared leaving a note saying ""I'll return, I just listened to the Wave calling me, it was not a pleasant invitation. It was a scream of pain"". 371 years later a city is founded after the alliance of the Missionaries and another batch of humans called Londinium. 28 years later a relative of Hato, Grica Wallace Irwin, sets out to find the truth behind the shady actions of duke Abraham Lucas and the fate of his long lost ancestor , Hato"	2
My suicidal thoughts.I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad. However I do want to express these problems and talk about them. I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now. I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not, wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head. I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic. Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it's almost no wonder they do. But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy, so easy compared to most people's it's pathetic. I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day. The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up. Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood. But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering. And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant. So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time. So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn't awful? I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I'm real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I'll die. I just feel so lost, I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please. I want to live for what I like all the time but I'm afraid that's too greedy, too much to ask for, the majority of people don't how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence? Does it even exist? Am I chasing after something that can never be attained? And if that's the case how do I endure the suffering? Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority. People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future. One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life. If you have anything to say please do I really want to hear your opinion on my circumstances. I have kept these thoughts to myself for too long.	1

"There's nothing life can offer me would make living worth it.I'm 22 years old, diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  I tried to kill myself by overdose last Christmas but landed in the psych ward instead.  I self-harm fairly often.  Sometimes that has kept me from trying to kill myself because I go numb when I cut.  In the past couple years I've been in and out of the hospital.  I spent 6 months in a partial hospitalization program before they gave up on me.  I've been in a mentalization based therapy program for the past year, but it hasn't been very helpful.  My family thought it might help if I got a psychiatric service dog, but I can't because one of my flatmates is deathly allergic to dogs.  It doesn't seem like any amount of therapy or medication has made me want to stay alive.  All I can do is cut to distract myself from wanting to die.  

I understand that there are a couple of people that would be hurt by me killing myself, but why should I constantly suffer just so a couple of people can go about their happy lives?  If they want me to be alive so fucking bad then they shouldn't leave me when I need someone the most."	1

I tried to improve my life by going to school but now I will have nothing but poverty, homelessness,  and debt that will follow me to the grave.  One of the worst parts is that there has not been ONE SINGLE DAY since then where I have felt glad that I did not succeed.  It has been nothing but a dark, painful, miserable journey.  All I ask for mow is the guts to go through with it and get it over with.  Don't tell people things will get better.  legalize euthanasia so people don't have to die in a horrifying, painful, and messy way.  We have to because this world is NOT for everyone.	1

"I just want her back.Me and my ex girlfriend had been going out for over a year. I loved her more than anything and to be honest I still do. She was my whole life, we did everything together, we went out pretty much every night and every weekend. She was my only friend

We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her ""friend"" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

It got to the point where on the night I broke with her, I flipped a coin, if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself. Thankfully it was heads but I'm getting back to that stage again. At school I have no friends anymore, when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that, so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at me

I can't even try to be friends with my ex because she can't even look at me and she won't tell me why. 

It's eating me up. I can't live like this anymore. 

I just want to wrap my arms around her and never let go. She is so intelligent and beautiful. She is the most amazing girl I have ever met. Now she has started to walk around with the ""friend"" who I mentioned before, that ""friend"" made my life hell for months, she is the reason why I have cut myself on many occasions, she also told her (My ex) to kill herself constantly to the point where she was about to. 

I just want her back, I can't live without her anymore. If she doesn't even say hello to me by next Friday, I'm just going to go and hang myself because I can't take it anymore "	1

"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

---
I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

If the text seems off it's my fault as my English is not so great as I think.

"i dont want to live anymoreI'm having a hard time because of my mother. I try to make my own things and she gets mad at me if she doesn't like it. I don't do things that are generally bad like skipping classes or failing my classes. I study a lot and get high grades but when I do one small thing she doesn't like she shouts at me and she takes away things of mine.

I usually walk home in my area to save money and she got mad at me for it. I really wanted to save up to go to a workshop because I dont want her to take overtime or work a part time job to get me that thing I can honestly save up for. When she knew about it she got mad at me and will take away half of my allowance that I need for other things. 

It honestly feels horrible at this point because it keeps happening over and over. She doesn't care about what I say about it at all. She just gets mad at me. I can't go to my other relatives because they'll send me back. I can't run away because running away in my country isn't really a good idea. I really cant take it anymore. I really just cant."	1
"I don't know what to do anymoreI'm 17, I've been depressed for 8 months and had thoughts of killing myself for 6, but its really getting to the point where I just want to end it.

Nothing I do is fun anymore, everything I used to do slowly got consumed by frustration. I see a therapist and take medicine, but neither really help. I have a friend who talks to me almost every day and she is pretty much the only reason I haven't done it, but I'm feeling like a nuisance to her. She's says a lot of the things I say to her are making her angry because she doesn't understand why I do/would want to do some of the things I say

I started to self harm a little bit, just scratching, but I really am thinking of cutting or more likely just ending my life soon. Idk what I'm trying to say with this, but I just want to die."	1

"I'm so tired...I've just gotta vent

I'm sick of the pain. I'm sick of never feeling good enough. I'm sick of feeling worthless, sick of feeling like I don't deserve anything good. I'm sick of being afraid of everything.

This has gotten so out of hand and I'm really worried about where it's going to take me. I never used to struggle with suicidal thoughts but now they're practically the only ones I have. 

I want to get help but I'm so afraid to reach out. My therapist already knows but she doesn't know the extent to which I have these thoughts. I don't know what to do.

I'm so tired of feeling like this, I just want this to be over, I want to be happy again..."	1
"I'm ending it on new year's day.I've posted on here before and the only response was a troll comment so idk why I'm posting again. I guess I just need to organize my thoughts somehow. I've been looking for a better job for well over a year now and I can't even get anyone to look at my resume. Ive been applying to several jobs a day, I actually have my default tabs set to job boards that I search and apply on in my spare time. Since I started I have has 4 interviews but they offered me less that I am making now even with my hours and responsibilities being cut.

I want to work so bad it is literally killing me inside that no-one will even look at my resume, or won't offer me a living wage.

I just found our that my rent is going up. One of my bills has also doubled because of a late fee since I couldn't afford to pay it on time. I am just so done. I hate myself and I hate my life but kost of all I hate living. For the first time since I moved out on my own I wasn't able to pay rent this month and my roommate had to make up the difference. It's looking like that will happen again next month and on top of that I have no idea how I can afford to pay my bills now. My savings is gone, cost of living is rising, and I am just a burden on those around me.

I'm tired of being a burden on others and I'm tired of working a dead end job that I despise knowing that no matter how hard I try I will never get out of it. I'm going to end it. My dad has inherited some guns over the years, he doesn't like using them, so he just keeps them locked up. I know how to get in to the safe. I am going to find a day I can go over there while they are at work and steal one. I don't want to live to see 2020. I don't want to live anymore. I'm just tired of being in pain all the time. I'm tired of constantly feeling like I am drowning."	1
Greetings r/SW.  Today I took it a step further and wrote it out....I actually wrote out my last day...I think this is a very negative turn of events.  Does anyone have the patience to listen to my story?	1
"I want to put my family through this.I am 23 years old and my entire family (four siblings and my mom) stopped talking to me last month. They also stopped letting me talk to or see my nieces 6 months ago. I was manic and delusional and put in the hospital for three weeks before they stopped talking to me. I was stable after a few days but that's how it works (especially when you have good insurance). My brothers took my dog to the pound while I was in the hospital, that devastated me and I was pissed at them when I got discharged. My family said they would stop talking to me if I didn't go to ""psych rehab"" (I haven't ever done illegal substances either than weed) but I wasn't about to be locked up again after having been locked up for three weeks. Or do what they say after they betrayed me like that. I think what my family did to me and is doing to me now is disgusting, it fills me with rage and sadness because I also feel like at this point I can't (and shouldn't) ever forgive them. They will never apologize and I don't see how that gets fixed without an apology. I have all the criteria for suicide and have been suicidal in the past, I can't believe they are abandoning me like this it puts me at a higher risk for suicide and I wish I would do it just to make them feel bad. Just to get them to see the seriousness of the situation. I'd love to post on facebook that the decision was made because on top of feeling like I have nothing left to live for and feeling like I can't cope with my pyschiatric issues anymore (or the side effects of the medications) my family doesn't care what happens to me either so what's the point? They have used me to vent their anger, made me into a joke and used me as a scapegoat my entire life but especially this year. I'm so fucking sick of being left out and abused I wish I could get back at them somehow."	1

"I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, never have to feel a thing again. I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression, free from the cage of anxiety and panic. I want to die."	1
"Read my old suicide note tonightRead my old suicide note tonight

A while back (couple months ago, so not too long ago) when my mental state was particularly bad I wrote out a suicide note. I didn’t have anything to say to my parents or any of my friends except one. I don’t feel like I need to give an explanation, I’d rather my issues die with me rather than existing in other people’s heads. I wrote the letter to the only friend who I’ve fully opened up to, and I was prepared to do it. Instead, I went to sleep. I’ve been struggling lately so I went back and read that note and got this strange sense of comfort. It made me feel so relaxed, maybe it was the idea that if I’d gotten that close to killing myself before and hadn’t, I could do it again."	1
Is it selfish telling someone?I'm thinking about opening up to one of my cousins. I'm not really close to him or anything, but he comes down to visit the uni I go to sometimes since he recently graduated. He also tried to get me into his frat and all, but I also feel like I let him down as I left during the process. I want to open up on how I tried committing and the other mental problems I have. I don't want a pity party or anything like that, I just want someone to know, especially family (as I'm usually always the 'loner' and don't really mingle well with others). But, I'm hesitant because I don't know if I'll try to commit again. I don't want for him to get hurt and all because of that (even though he'll probably already feel bad about me dying, but I don't want it to torment him or something).	1
"What's the easiest way to kill myselfPlease don't put ""don't kill yourself we need you!"" Or anything in the comments, I'll do it with or without your help, but for my sake I hope you help me. I'm 15 I have 2 mentally abusive parents. I've been able to stop their abuse for a while by doing everything they want but now I'm failing school. It's started every thing back up so much worse. I get really full from my big school lunches but my mom forces me to eat when I come home, but then when I eat she asks why I'm being a pig. Im healthy but it's not enough. Im trying to juggle school and their chores for me but I can't. I'm sorry, I'm a coward and I know it. I can't run away because I don't want to be out there alone, I'm scared of what would happen to me since I'm a girl. I've tried looking into national runaway service but I would need a safe place to stay I really need y'all's help. I'm to much of a coward to cut or hang myself or anything violent but we don't have any pills that could do the job. What can I do? I can't last here 3 more years I just can't, I had a boyfriend that was helping me a while back but they texted him pretending to be me and started a huge fight with them and then they blocked him on my phone. He was so sweet and kind and it's been months since that happened so I'm sure he's so mad at me he wouldn't even consider helping me at this point. I have no one else. Please help me"	1
I need some helpI feel really terrible right now I spent the entire day burning my self with matches. I really need to talk to anyone to help me feel better or I'm not sure I'll wake up tomorrow	1
"I'm probably mad to post this and I regret you reading it I'm not over emotional. Or at least, I'm not the kind who cries in movies or songs. And I hate to cry.

So why in the hell could I not go through one night this week without crying??

I could never relate to all you guys saying ""I feel so alone"" or ""I'm depressed"" and I always felt like an outsider in this sense. I mean, I have a great life and I don't like people complaining when they have a great life too!

I won't go into details here (simply because it's boring) but I consider the life I'm leading extremely lucky.

And suddenly it was like a ""welcome to the club"" moment. 

And I always ask myself, *what changed?* Is this a teenager phase that will pass soon? Or is this more... real?

I have no friends other than two guys I met online and never actually met. I can't find myself. I have a beautiful family: but it just feels like they don't know me. I'm constantly bored. And I go on walks everyday just to get out of this life - even if it's just for an hour. And seriously, why? As I said, I have a great life. So what changed?

I don't know why I'm writing this and I don't know why you are reading this, but it feels good somehow to do this. So thanks I guess.

"Does anyone not want to help themselves? Because I don't...I'm at the point where I don't want to try anymore. I've tried it all, and I've been wanting to die since I was 12 years old (I'm 28/F).

Now, I've successfully sabotaged my life so that I lost my job, my boyfriend, I'm pushing my friends/family away. All I want to do is make sure my family doesn't have to deal with too much of the aftermath. 

I used to want to try. I spent countless years researching all to know about mental health/psychology, the different therapies to treat them, therapy, exercise, hobbies, relationships, creating things....I'm just all out of fight and I feel like that's too pathetic. My boyfriend is leaving me because I don't have the will to live anymore....

I want things to be over so badly.

"These stupid ads &gt;:( I’m just scrolling through reddit in the dark abyss of my room. Then this bright ass ad slides through and singes my cornea. The ad isn’t even good, they’re just trying to sell me baby yoda underwear. Like I don’t even want it. 

Well thats the rant. Good night and I bid your eyes good luck."	2
"This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but I’m scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years I’ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we don’t always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however I’m terrified that if my face gets out there one day I’ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn’t have happened, that I should have never done it and since then it’s been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I can’t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, I’d be scared someone would find out, I’m scared I’d break down, I’m scared I’d lose my place in college.

I’ve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections. 

It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head. I wasn’t forced to do what I did, I was a stupid child who didn’t know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was. I was naive and now it’ll haunt me for the rest of my life, however long that’ll be anyways. 

Thank you for reading this strangers of Reddit.

This is the first and only time I’ll ever get to say these words."	1
"If he leaves me, I lose everything.I will have to quit school. Move back in with my parents who do nothing but cut me down. Stop seeing friends regularly. Stop volunteering. Lose everything. Start from scratch. 

Lose him. I love him so much and – I know the answer is always “you *will* find love again!” – but I won’t. Not this time. You don’t understand how much I love him. 

My whole life is over if he leaves me tonight. The grief aside, my life will logistically be over and I’ll have to go back to spending all of my time at home alone because I can’t drive and can’t afford to move out of my parents house in the middle of nowhere to somewhere with public transit. I will have to either drop out of school or wake up at 3am every single day and walk an hour in the snow to catch an early bus into the city. And no more of my sweet best friend at home to make the struggle feel worth it. It feels like a truck is sitting on my chest and I can’t focus, can’t study, can’t rest, can’t stop shaking. "	1

"I hate the reddit hivemind If your opinion differs even slightly from the generally leftist points of view on most subs, then you get so, so much hate. Harsh personal insults from people who claim that they are fighting against bullying. The hypocrisy. Calling your opinion ""not real"" and '""bullshit"" while flaunting their own. Keep in mind I said nothing sexist or racist, just appropriately shared my opinion on a sub. I knew it would get hate but how could I know that full grown adults would act so immature and attack someone for having a different opinion. I am not right wing in any way, but I can see how people can turn into bitter far right racists with equally terrible views from this. I hate people who claim to have an open mind but have no room accepting that people with different opinions exist. My comment on r/niceguys may have been unpopular, and I'm not offended by what people say, just shocked that grown adults can be such shitty people hiding behind a screen. I pray to a god, if one exists that I never become as bitter and close-minded as they are. You can check my post history for yourself and see if you think my opinion was worth me being called many names by people almost three times my age. I also inboxed a redditor to explain my point of view but somehow she claimed it was inappropriate and sexual. Like wtf. Anyways, thats my rant, basic "" I hate the haters"" rant."	2

"Last ditch effortWhen I was a kid I was abused by my biological dad. I've had a speech impediment my entire life that makes me sound mentally ill. No one takes me seriously. When I was in middle school I was relentlessly bullied. On my second year of college I was diagnosed with Luekemia. Unfortunately, it didn't kill me. My mom and dad divorced and it was so ugly. After I dropped out I realized I was trans. Now every day someone says something to me about how I'm a pervert or a freak. People online are so vile. My anxiety has been ruthless since I was a child. I can't hold a job because I get too scared to go in after the 3rd day. I'm 25 years old, don't have a job, can't keep one. I'm fat. I'm bald. I'm trans. I don't have any worth because I can't labor and so I'm just a parasite on my dad and mom. Every job I attempt (dozens) ive failed at. Its so much. When i do work i come home crying, and in the mornings before i go in i get so scared I throw up. But you need money to live and I dont wanna keep being a burden and pathetic

I don't know what to do. I've tried dozens of medications. Multiple therapists. I was on disability for a while for the cancer, but it ended now. I'm too anxious to leave the house. I'm too anxious to make phone calls or work or do anything. What options do I even have left besides killing myself? 

I'm sorry that this is just a bunch of self pity. I just tried to list things"	1

"Should I leave a note?I am a 20 year old female. My parents decided that it was a good idea to have a baby with someone they met at AA and subsequently divorced when I was 4. I've been in therapy since I was 8. My first psychiatric inpatient admission was when I was 16 but once I graduated high school, everything went downhill. 

I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications. 

Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me. 

I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.

Besides a living will that will say to take me off life support if heavily brain damaged, is there much point in leaving a note at this point? It's pretty much expected at this point.

"Help..? IdkI've been thinking about this since my first attempt. Which was years ago. My life is just so insignificant, and everything I do I don't like. I just want to end it. I know no one really cares. My mom has even threatened to put me in the hospital (said when I did my second attempt) if I cut or tried again and I have told no one because I'm scared. 

Maybe it will be better if I was gone.

I know no one cares, but i want to live, but this world is so hard and so scary. Always thinking about what is wrong with everyone and everything. 

I'm only posting this because I feel somewhat safe. Yannow, being anoymus and all. 

Im always suffering, even when I'm laying around doing what I want, I guess I just want someone to care? I don't know what u want anymore. I have a therapist but I'm scared to tell her about some stuff. Being scared of people, basically everything. It's so tiring. I'm always tired. 

Another thing that bothers me is that I'll always be alone. Even when with people. It's a suffocating feeling, all the time. 

If I do do it,and succeed, I want my parents to take better care of the cats, like I do and I want j and c to each have half of my kpop belongings. (sorry I sound like a 5 year old) I want my brother to keep going and act like nothing happened, I know he's always wanted to be an only child. 

I just want to give up. This is so hard to type out. But I need to get this off my chest. I hope no one I know will find this and confront me. If you do know me, don't say anything, thank you."	1

"My life is falling apartHi all, 

This is my first and maybe last post on here. I’ve had a pretty easy life. I went to good schools. I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each other’s backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.

A few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mother’s Day and just didn’t see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact I’m going to prison for 2+ years. She’s also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out they’ve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently I’m just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it. 

I’ve always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like I’ve let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasn’t popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had. 

So basically I’ve decided to end it. My entire life I’ve let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. I’ve lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon I’m going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me. 

Now it’s just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning. I’m not sure when I’ll go through with it, maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks or maybe when I’m in prison. 

So long reddit."	1
"when you want to date people because women are kinda hot ngl but you also are worried about leaving your friend behind because you love your friends and know that hes insecure about being replaced by people and obviously you dont want to replace her and youre worried youd end up spending less and less time with her and eventually drift apart, which in itself is one of your biggest fears, so instead of doing anything you just cry because you dont know what else to do !!!

&amp;#x200B;

edit: also you dont even know if you feel romantic attraction at all and you just need an excuse to spend time with people because you have a crippling fear of being alone!!!!!"	2

Your Personal Brian Everybody had a Brian. Sometimes one’s Brian is big, sometimes it’s small, all Brians have their uses though. Your Brian can learn. If you teach it right. Some Brians like school. Some Brians like video games. No Brians ever get credit where deserved. Treat your personal Brian with respect and care, do not be mean to Brian or your Brian will make you sad. All Brians should be nurtured and taken care of. They should be trained daily. All Brians should exercise. Make sure your Brian exercises often enough or they will start rotting. Keep your Brian healthy.	2

"Work related burnout and suicidal thoughts?I'm happy, I'm married, I have a nice two bedroom apartment, I have a game room (basically a man cave), I'm furthering my education and I'm doing well. Things are good. In another year I can probably start a family but there is this god damn fucking voice, going ""whats it matter, sure the book is good but you can just close it and not have to deal with any of this bullshit"". I hate working. I hate waking up every morning, having to leave the house, and do literally anything. It's one thing when its going to classes, I enjoy that, learning/etc. But my experiment? It has me literally wanting to fucking off myself because I'm so god damn tired of doing it. I'm tired of coming in on holidays, I'm tired of dealing with my emotional problems and mental crap (I'm autistic, ocd and have severe ADHD).

It feels weird being happy and having suicidal thoughts. I know it'll end. I'll move onto something else, but this burnout is still there nonetheless and I don't know what to do. "	1
I feel really insignificant in peoples lives I know people are worried about themselves the most but I just wanna be someone’s favorite. I just wanna know what that’s like. I don’t think anyone really hates me (that happened to me before but I think we’re good now.) I’m just this random person that no one thinks twice about. I don’t even feel like a real person that can actually affect people. I feel like I don’t even have that kind of power. People don’t take me seriously and I barely talk to the people I thought were my friends. I don’t know if that’s a me problem or a them problem. I don’t wanna get in to that though. In my closet friendships I’ve ever had I’m never the favorite or there’s always someone better than me that they’d rather hang out with. I just wish someone would actually acknowledge my existence, I hate this	2
Serious Answers Only Please, unless it’s funny. I started talking to this girl recently, but now she’s all I can think of. I can’t even play games or masturbate, I just sit and stare at space wondering if I’m approaching her right or if things will work out. Is this normal or am I just down bad?	2
I'm going home. We're all going home.Non-existence, we were there for eternity. Life is simply a vacation, one that I am growing tired of each day. But, it's ok, the pain will cease. Each and every one of us, we'll get there, we all go home. I love you. 	1
"I'm heading back into that direction...Sorry about the length.

A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.

I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.

I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.

 I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

tl;dr Was in a rut, tried to kill myself. Got help, and now I'm crawling back into my hole."	1

"Stop making suicide about you.I’m sorry to rant. I really am. I was just reading a post about a guy who had an acquaintance die by suicide and how he’s feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I know it’s a terrible thing, but what bothers me is that the comment section is all like “ohh I am so sorry for you and I can’t imagine what you are going through”.  

Are you fucking serious? This is not about him a human being has died and he’s thinking about his fucking self. God damn this just reaffirms my wanting to die. Like people don’t care. They only want to stop you from killing yourself and don’t care about the pain you’re in because they don’t want to feel bad about your death. This is it. No one wants to feel bad about your death so just stay alive and suffer endlessly. 

Gosh. Poor dude that killed himself. I really don’t want to imagine the type of pain and suffering that went through his head. If death brought him more peace than this life ever did then may he be in eternal peace. So fucking selfish. Everything."	1
Am I the only one mad about this? Girls be calling each other sexy and hot on each other’s Instagram. But I remember that time last year where I gave my boy Kenneth a bro hug. Not a loving hug, like one you would give your mom, but just a simple bro hug. If you do not know, a guy hug is when you and the person you are hugging handshake, pull yourselves to each other, and pat the other guys back twice. I did that, and this girl and her group of friends called me and my boy gay. That same girl is the one who calls other girls sexy and hot in the Instagram comments. I cannot be the only one annoyed by this.	2

"And here I am once again.Back to feeling extremely suicidal again. I made a post in /r/depression a few days ago, hoping I wouldn't get this suicidal again. I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago (not in a way I had to see a hospital) and I never told anyone in real life about it. 
My family knows I'm really depressed and they wish they could help me. My mother tried so hard to make me feel a little better, it just doesn't work out at all.

I have too many repressed memories. I'm sick and basically stuck in bed, can't go out and do things, yet alone go to school or have a job. I'm alone. Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him. And he didn't leave me because he didn't love me anymore or for any other usual breakup reason. I can't forget about him.

It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.
Knowing that nobody else can give me this kind of support. Knowing that this post and all the replies won't make me feel any better. It just seems impossible."	1
I feel like everyone has given up on me, so why should I live anymore?Last week, I had a falling out with my girlfriend. I thought she was cheating, and in reality I was just way to suspicious and judgemental. She says we are fine, that it was an honest mistake, but she hasn't answered my calls or texts for a few days. My parents think I'm fucked up, that I have to steal from them. It's just small amounts of food, but they grounded me for a month. Now, I have to cancel all my plans and I'm too embarrassed to tell why. My bandmates have given up on me, they found someone better to replace me. My grades are falling fast. Is it better to just kill myself? I don't think anyone will care, and I won't have to face people anymore. I think I'm going to do it	1
Let’s be real...The only reason suicide is frowned upon and shown as “taking the easy way out” is because governing bodies don’t want to lose the revenue you will create with your taxes and “contribution” to society.	1
"Back here again...I don't know if this happened on its own or because I quit the meds that I don't think I need. They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.

The thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.

I'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.

I won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.

It's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition. This leaves me with no choice. It's going to end soon. "	1

"It feels like it's creeping up on me, not sure how much longer I can go on with it.It's been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of 51. I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.

It used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.

I feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.

I feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them. She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself, but now all I get is tough love."	1
"In 2016 I was really sick, I wasn’t supposed to survive. I really wish I hadn’t. My pain would have been over then.In 2016 I had both MRSA and pneumonia at the same time. I spent a month in a room where people had to wear masks, face shields, aprons and gloves. Even when people came in to feed me. I didn’t see faces for a month.

Each cough brought up blood and mucus. All those coughs, From the first to the last were like knives in my rib cage. After I was released I was coughing up junk for almost 2-3 weeks.

I was treated with large amounts of mucinex, prednisone, levofloxacin and inhaling water like it was air. I was on large doses of Narco with an anti nausea medication for the pain. Why didn’t I die then?

I later found out I wasn’t supposed to survive according to my doctors. 

It has lasting effects, I’m immune compromised, I’ve got scar tissue in my lungs. I wish I’d died. By dying then, so many things would have ended. Things world be peaceful."	1

"Lied my way out of the psych ward.So a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt. Someone said I should and I decided to do it. I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday. I was telling them that I felt better, when in reality I still feel like killing myself. I just didn't want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn't give a shit. I told him that I wasn't feeling good when he asked how I was doing, and he said ""If I went to the grocery store, and asked how the clerk was doing, I expect them to say good, because that's the polite thing to do. I don't want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing"" which made no fucking sense because it's not a grocery store it's a fucking psych ward. I'm supposed to be honest with how I am feeling. After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life. He clearly didn't give a fuck. I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don't know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated"	1

The thought of not doing something meaningful with my life makes me just want to give up, which I realize is totally counterintuitive, but it just makes me hopeless.

I'll be a fucking dishwasher or some shit my whole life, serving people that actually have their shit together. Fuck that, I'd rather just die now, and I just might.	1

"[Important] TikTok is NOT for kids. TikTok is a shady and mostly unmoderated area place with porn.

So this is just plain bad. Kids in GRADE FUCKING THREE are using TikTok and have (probably) seen porn before because of TikTok.

Types of porn on TikTok include people showing off their bare butt, full body cam of naked people, and girls showing boobs.

So TikTok is a place if you're willing to see porn. Otherwise go elsewhere safer because you're not supposed to go on TikTok at school.

However, our school district not only blocks the website but also the API so TikTok is blocked, even on the mobile app.

While TikTok might be an ""excitement"" during the COVID pandemic, TikTok is NOT a safe place. Make sure to read the reviews of the app, website, or product before downloading/accessing it."	2

"Suicide is not an option for me. That's not just a tired saying, it's my reality. But if it's the only thing I can think about, where do I go from here?I cross-posted from r/depression. I'm sorry if you see this twice. 

I've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.

I have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.

Suicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.

I'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.

I have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.

I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.

It's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.

I just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful."	1

Somebody told my friends to kill themselveSo, a bit of backstory. Me and my friends have all been at the school since kindergarten and had known each other for ages. Some of the people in my friends classes started telling them to commit suicide. Both of my friends have depression/anxiety and I don't know what to say or how to support them. What things could I say to them to help them, and let them know that they're not alone?	1

"I'm finally at a breaking pointI have no idea why I am writing this right now. I'm 29 and I'm a fucking loser. I'm a miserable person who sees all the negatives in any situation. I've fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me. Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can't seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn't involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time. 

My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree. I have no real skills that can get me a job, I've been unemployed for two years straight almost. I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable. I'm pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling. I can't put it into words, I'd just go to the job and start to feel panicked. I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to. 

Now I'm sitting here jobless wondering what do I do? Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can't handle it? Probably. My father thinks I'm a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won't come right out and say it. He's ashamed of me and that crushes me, but there's nothing I can do. Shame is something I've come used to, it scares me less than the stress I am going through. 

I've never had a girlfriend, I've never really kissed a girl, I've never had anyone love me back. I've never had someone I could put my arm around and say ""I love you too"" to me. I live completely alone without another living soul around me. I didn't used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel 'normal'. Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better. 

I've been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future. I'm almost 30 years old and there's nothing good out there coming. I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and it's just too late. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn't get it. They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said 'better' and then they figured I was past it all. I wasn't. 

They told me I need to talk to someone, but I can't afford to go talk to a professional. And even if I did, where do I start? How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it? There's no digging myself out of this hole I'm in. I'm stuck and I'm going to stay stuck. It's too late for me to start changing, too late for me to get a girl, too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public. So fuck it, right? 

I'm crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don't know how to make it all stop. I don't know why I'm putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to do it, but I'm too afraid. I've tried before, but I always chicken out. I'm useless even at that. 

Again, I just don't know why I'm writing all this. I'm somewhat of a writer, maybe I'm hoping it'll make me feel better? I was wrong. Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it. Jesus, what do I do? Do I keep limping along, making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up? Wouldn't it be BETTER for me to just end it? "	1
"BreakupIm 30/m and my girlfriend 21/f left me two weeks ago. She was unhappy sexually b/c I'm not old enough for her. She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me. When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before. Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up. I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself. I just feel like its all getting worse and I cant change it. When I was trying to get sober I thought about killing myself a lot for the same reason. All this work to do and no energy. Ive come to the conclusion that doing work, whether for money or personal growth is the way to being ol and somewhat of a whole person but I just dont know how. I have all this work to do and I dont have the energy or give a shit enough about anything to get started. I know objectively what is supposed to work. ""Dont talk to her"" ""Get work done"" ""Distract yourself"" ""Get exercise"" Has anyone been in a situation like this? Where you found the person you thought was the right one for you and then one day it just all fell apart? She still loves me and I her but we cant be together and its just getting harder as time goes bye.

"My chronic depression is getting worse... This world feels like a nightmare. [NSFL]I'm thinking about suicide a lot...

I want to be dead. I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not. 

They're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know! And that hurts even more. 

If only I could go somewhere else. "	1
"Ah,I feel so apathetic to everything. All I do is cause people pain and yet I even feel numb to the guilt. A very, very small part of me is scared of potentially hurting someone badly in my life and it makes me wanna kill myself. The rest of me is kind of hoping I hurt someone and that part of me also makes me wanna kill myself so I can leave a lasting impression on whoever knows me and/or whoever finds my body.

If this gets much worse I think I will go through with it. Or at least attempt so if I survive I can feel something, even if it's just suffering."	1
"I don't want to get better. I want to die.I can't see myself ever being happy or content anyway. Even if I got over my social anxiety, got a good job, moved to a great new country, had caring friends and family, had a partner, had a nice house and fulfilling hobbies, even then, I'd still be depressed and empty. I might be less depressed, but it wouldn't go away.

I'm tired of being told to get help or open up to someone. The only advice you ever get is ""it gets better"" and ""think about your family"". Well, I don't care anymore. I'm tired. Why is not wanting to live so frowned upon? I tried living, and it's not for me. Stop trying to save me and just let me die painlessly."	1
Dont think I was meant to be a mom, maybe I'll kill myself insteadSince having my baby in January I've been increasingly depressed, angry, and anxious. I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life. I don't see it getting better. Just worse. So why stick around?	1

"Day 5 of posting things related to the Internațional Waffles Day(Google must be confused about why I searched for this every day) Waffle Day has recently begun to be celebrated in other countries as well, often ushered in by restaurants and cafés specialising in waffles, as in India, where the Belgian Waffle Co. in 2018 declared that they would celebrate National Waffle Day in July, or in Norway, where Waffle Day was all but unknown until producers of waffle irons, milk and flour started to promote waffle day in the mid-2010s. In the United States, National Waffle Day is celebrated in August to commemorate the date of a U.S. patent on a waffle iron; however the celebration is described as ""at best a 'bizarre' or 'unique' holiday – the fluff stuff of radio DJ commentary"", a frequent criticism of food celebration days. Some people love the occasion and think of it as a real festival whereas others don't really like or understand it."	2
"I'm a disgusting piece of shit and here is my rant.I'm so fucking done. I recently moved to the other side of the country for my internship, better said: to work fulltime without even getting paid. I have literally nobody here; all my coworkers are at least ten years older (seriously), I can't join any sportsclub or other activities around here cause I'm not an official student so I'm not welcome there. All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).

I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible. So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much. I never felt wanted in my entire life, and even he, after all this time, won't spend time with me. He's probably gonna break up with me soon cause I'm a depressed, hidious piece of shit with no friends who's always yelling and ruining everything. 

Things were finally getting better for me; I quit drugs after using almost half of my life, I started to eat better and to exercise, but nothing helps. I'm still the same disgusting whore, and I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm probably just gonna go to that stupid party, eventhough it's two and a half hours by train and I've been vomiting my brains out for the past 24hrs. I just really want to feel like a whole person, okay. I don't want to die, but trust me, I want to, if you know what I mean :/"	1
I'm smart enough to know how dumb I am but I'm not smart enough to fix that. I just felt like you should know that.	2
"I've got everything going for me and yet...Hi Reddit,

This is my first time posting ever. I need help. I've been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I take my pills every day. I'm surrounded by people that love me. I've been told I'm pretty, talented, funny, nice, etc. I have a boyfriend. I have a loving family that is paying for my college education (though I dropped out because the depression was so bad). I have a roof over my head. I was in a sorority surrounded by tons of friends. I used to be a division I athlete before I dropped out. Everything is right in my life.
Everything, except me. I'm miserable all the time. I honestly want to kill myself. I've tried twice to hang myself but it didn't work. All I got was the impression of a rope around my neck. I've never felt this down in my life. I think of all the mistakes I've made and I just wish I could go back in time and relive my life, knowing what I do now. I don't know what to do. If I didn't live in a state where it was so hard to get a gun I probably would have shot myself a long time ago.
I know this is just rambling and probably doesn't make any sense, but I just want to get everything out. 
I'm so sorry I feel this way. I shouldn't."	1
"Least physically painful way to do itI’m a pussy, I’m scared of the pain even tho I wanna die, shooting myself tho sounds cause I’ll probably die before feeling the pain but idk where I can get a firearm quickly in the uk. 

Also how do I make it easier for others. That’s the hardest thing keeping me here, they don’t deserve the unnecessary pain. Wish I could just vanish without anyone knowing, just wanna go and be like I never existed"	1
"I really want to attempt but I’m too scared that everything will just be magically better right as I stab myselfFor the past few months I’ve just been in “oh shit I’m going to die” mode. I’ve been doing everything I can bring myself to do that will positively affect my mood even if it’s only for a little while. My parents are confused as to why I’m just disobeying them and my dad is getting even angrier at me daily. This disobedience has only made them take away things that helped me. And the worse my mental state is the more desperate I am to try to bring it up to even the slightest bit. I don’t have the strength to tell them how bad I’m doing and I can’t afford help even if I could get to it. Talking to my friend has helped a lot but I’m still getting worse everyday. I feel like I’m in quicksand and everything I do to try to get out only makes me sink myself even further down. I don’t believe I will survive two more years of this. I wish I had the strength to get help. I’m wasting the opportunity for a cheap higher education by tanking my grades because I don’t have the energy to do anything. And every time my parents see my grades I’m reminded how much of a failure I am. And to top it all off I get to be dysphoric too as of recently. Fun.

Sorry for ranting

Tl;dr I want the pain to end"	1

"I feel like i'm just living because of other people, not because I have a will to live.The thought of killing myself gives me peace. All I want to do is end my life, but I can't do that because I love my parents and family, and killing myself is so selfish. I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myslef is because I don't want to hurt the people that care about me. But I feel so unhappy and like my life is going nowhere, cause I'd love most of all to be dead. I feel numb, and every meaningless task just adds to the dull lie that I live with everyday. My life has no meaning, I don't want to live, but I can't end it cause I don't want to hurt my family. I feel like I'm in an empathetic paradox

God I hate being so so lonely and I just want to kill myself so badly.

"I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. It’s not the first time. I’ve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I’d miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn’t want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn’t everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.

It wasn’t until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn’t take her son to school today. He didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn’t be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I’d never finished school, how I didn’t have a job, how I didn’t have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.

A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.

She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.

I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.

I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I’d tell anyone who would listen about my plans.

I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn’t have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn’t I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn’t. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, “Not yet. I can’t do that to my family.”

But I think about it now that I’m older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""

Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead."	1
"Confusion, suicide and a sick petI’ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. It’s different this time though because I truly feel I’m not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because it’s going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isn’t worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I can’t trust my own brain, my mind. It’s the worst it’s ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. He’s going downhill and the doctors just figured out what’s going on but the situation is dire it’s probably too late. I don’t know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime he’s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well I’m suicidal, I don’t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said it’s not torture. That he looks worse than he is. I’m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I don’t want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like he’s always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless I’m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I don’t know if it’s good for him or me to keep doing this. I don’t know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didn’t do everything I could. And I don’t know if that outweighs the anger I’m going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible. 

I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isn’t worth it. We could be released from everything.

I'm killing myself tonight because I have literally no reason to be here anymore. I'm fed up with everything, the girl I've known for two years has been a blessing, she's been a crutch for me when I've needed it, she's helped me through everything and I've helped her. 
I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.

Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.

But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)

So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself. Tonight the war was lost. I'll send a link of this to her so maybe she can read it. Not that it matters, I've made this up before, but I'm truly going through with it tonight. I'm gonna smoke, then go for a walk, and never look back. Probably won't make it through the night. I love you..if you're reading this. It's not your fault, you've been the reason I've made it to this age. I would've given up before if it weren't for you. I hope you can find happiness, I know I did.

I no longer feel pain,remorse,grief, anger, or anything. I've gone numb. I've given up. All that I really want now is to experience that pure calm of eternal nothingness. "	1

"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. 

Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. 

I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. 

I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. 

They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). 

They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: 

SO: I want to die 

me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? 

SO: I'm already hurting myself 

me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? 

SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. 

A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?"" 

That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. 

I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. 

What should I do, you guys? I don’t know what is going on, I don’t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don’t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don’t know if I should stay with them if this continues—not because they have depression, but because they won’t address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. 
We’ve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I’m not an antidepressant. I’m a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don’t want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.

"A Popular YouTuber committed suicide, and I'm really just thinking about myself.I've posted here before.  Lots of times.  I've gone on about why I feel suicidal and how I don't believe suicide is the wrong choice for some people.  So don't think I'm only posting here because his death made me want to talk about things.

Anyways, I admire his courage.  I am far too afraid to kill myself, even though I know I should.

I'm bitter that this person is getting so much attention on social media, so much *affection* on social media.  I'm jealous.  I want a modicum of that affection.

And yet I know that if I got it, it wouldn't matter because I'll only accept it if it comes from certain people, the ones I seemingly arbitrarily decided to declare ""important"".

I deserve to die and yet I live.  When I'm gone I know no one will mourn the same way for me.

P.S. I want to warn everyone on social media sharing the suicide hotlines and all that about how those hotlines are terrible for helping those in need as most of us have found out. But I don't want to deal with all that."	1

Can't handle my situationMy life is in shambles. But at the core is my looks, if I looked normal and felt normal I would be incredibly happy even with the million of problems that have built up. Because I know I can solve em. Instead I know that I'll just keep being incredibly miserable with no end, things can only get worse. Is there any method to overcome something like this? I keep thinking about suicide but I don't think I'll ever do it, yet I can't take it anymore either.	1
"My wife wants a divorce.. 

My wife and I are splitting up. Its because of years of me choosing weed over my family like my sons birthday, my anniversary, all of it... It's all my fault. The women that I spent 5 years of my life married too, had a wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter and son with.. Idk how to do this.

All I want is to kill myself. I don't want to think about.. splitting up material bullshit.. or .. fuck man.. or even how we're suppose to talk to each other now. I'm madly in love with this woman but.. somehow it wasn't enough to overcome my own selfishness. I've ruined the only thing I've ever wanted, a real family. I don't know where I'm suppose to go.. how do I drive now that I'm leaving her with the car, the bills, the kids, my heart, fuck... everything is with this woman. I couldn't stand to see her happy with someone else, but I do wish her nothing but happiness. I just.. she's been kissing me and I was just told its because I want it. She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here. I know I am and no matter how many tears I cry it'll never fix what I once had.

If I'm not going to kill myself, then I need to know how to do this. She works 40 hours during the week on days, and I work 2 12's on saturday and sunday so money isn't exactly easy to come by. What about my babies.. how does the mother of my children sustain their living situation and her own without me around to watch them while she works. I'm sure she'll find a way. I'm just really scared.

I dont want to do this. I don't want this.. I'm so sorry."	1

"Depression is my life...I have had depression for the majority of my teenage to adult life. And I feel like I am at a loss; I have planned and contemplated suicide multiple times but always back out due to fear. I feel the NHS does not do enough until it is too late ( I am English.) I have no idea what to do anymore as I honestly do not know how to cope, I feel like I am at a loss and just existing until I die. I came here to see if anyone else is feeling the same or if anyone who has been through this and came out the other side. All I have that get's me through it is my beautiful girlfriend, family and my music  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IUS9yqVpxk) but I find it always ends up being about my depression, I am just hoping someone who reads this can help as I don't know what to do any more....

thank you for reading."	1
"I have never had this sort of urge before.I have never had this urge to take something across my wrist, or swallow pills, or jump off something high. I just can't take the mental anguish anymore. Everyday I wake up stressed and worry. My sleep sucks anymore and I don't have an appetite. Things I used to enjoy, I can't stand to do them for longer than 30 minutes anymore.

I've always been depressed for as long as I can remember. This just feels different though. I want it all to stop. I would turn to drugs and alcohol, but I can't even afford those. They only thing keeping me here is my family and girlfriend. If I were to do it, I can't stand to think the hurt they would go through. 

I just don't want to deal with the stress anymore. I want to sit down and not worry about something for one damn minute. I have no sexual urges anymore as a result of anxiety and depression. The outlook for my future is bleak and I feel, hopeless. I have thought of different ways to do it, and I feel like bleeding out is the most sure way and painless. Pass-out from blood-loss and my heart can't revive it's self without blood. 

Anyways thanks for taking the time to read. I know everyone has their own problems. This just feels therapeutic writing on here. I guess I need help, but I don't want to get any. whywhodo8."	1

"Love is the only thing that gave this struggle any meaning. Without love, there's no reason to endure. Even if it gets better, what's it for if there's no one to share it with?My mom really wants me to hold on. I imagine my dad and siblings would hurt for a while. My grandma might die (I have always been her favorite for some reason). But why should that matter? It's sick that they think they are happier keeping me alive, in misery. I want to check myself into a psych ward for 2 weeks, but other than staying alive cuz my mom keeps telling me to...I don't know why I should. My life as never been ""good"" or ""easy"" or ""fun."" I'm not waiting around for it to get ""good"" or ""fun"" because I'm beyond that now. I know all that is empty and meaningless. It seems like such a waist to put in all the effort it takes to overcome this, only to be able to live apathetically. Why go to work? why pay my bills? why eat? why shower? if I'm not having any fun? When the emotions and the thoughts pass, I still won't be having any fun because I either 1) can't appreciate me and my life on my own (i.e. without the partner who I thought was my soul mate), OR 2) there is no incentive to put up with this shitty world and the people in it on a daily basis. I don't want this world or this life--I have legit been trying to run away from it since I was 12...17 years later and I still want to run away, and now I don't have high school, lost virginity, drug experimentation, college, love, starting a family, professional career, or any of those milestones to look forward to.

I feel like I have to prove I’m black enough to receive black love and community.it makes me anxious if I can’t afford to tip because I am black my hair fell out too ...

"It's just one more monthHey,

Was planning to post in /r/depression, but this felt more appropriate.

To sum up, I'm transgender, 20 years old, extremely severe depression, no treatment. Went off one of my anti-depressants a month ago due to side effects, asked my doctors office for an emergency appointment.

Still haven't heard from them. Things are worse than ever. Today I got out of bed, went straight into the bath and fell asleep. Five hours later I got up and went back to bed and slept until my mother got home.

After she walked the dogs, she asked me what I had for lunch. I considered lying, but I didn't have the energy. I told her that I had a piece of old stale bread for lunch, which was the truth. She got angry that I wasn't eating properly, not upset, not sad, angry. She then got angry I didn't empty the dishwasher.

After a while, she came back to my room and told me that she wasn't cooking dinner for me if I stayed in bed. I couldn't bring myself to respond, I just laid there. She's currently eating dinner, and I'm in my room still.

In a month I meet with the trans care people again. This time they might tell me that they've decided to treat me. Probably not though, it's been 2 years and they haven't moved a step in that direction.

I know that I would probably feel better if I actually managed to see my doctor and get another med. I know I probably wouldn't be spending the entire day sleeping and/or thinking about ending it. I can't bring myself to do anything, though. I can't pick up the phone. I can't eat.

I don't know how to keep climbing out of this ever deepening hole."	1
"I need to feel someone else’s skin against mineAnd soon. Otherwise I swear to God I’m gonna end my life. 

Reading posts where guys complain about the impossibility of attracting girls because of their supposed bad looks makes feel even more worthless because I know girls like me. They look at me all the time, I’ve missed millions of opportunities. But I feel so unable to reach out. Like I’m trapped inside myself for having been isolated for so long. 

I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
Also I’m fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and they’re getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 

The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 

And believe me I’m not letting myself go. I’m fighting with all I got. I’ve quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist. 

But no matter the efforts and although I’m getting positive results in some regards, the loneliness is just too fuckin’ unbearable. 
And everyday, little by little, I’m losing my will to live. I end up crying in my bed almost every night. "	1

"Feels like I have nothing to live for anymore.I feel dead already. The only thing that's stopping me is the fact that it's going to hurt and that I may have potential to survive this all until the end and live a good life with somebody who loves/cares for me.

I highly doubt that though.

My mother has verbally abused me (and almost physically) since I was a young teen, about 13-14 years old. Ever since I was that age she has been constantly talking about financial issues, my Dad, our broken family, negative complaints about herself hating life and other bad toxic things, basically manipulating my train of thought all this time and self-esteem.

I feel like an alien among other people my age because I have grown up so sheltered and uneducated. I feel like I'm wasting my time and there's nothing out there for me.

I hate my family, I think they're all disgusting people. I hate my parents, especially my mother. I have like one friend and I most often hate her because she's younger than me and we don't match as people anymore, then one other friend I sleep with of whom will probably drop me due to my boring life and lack of care for things these days.

&amp;#x200B;

I literally feel like this year is it for me.

I'm a burden and I've been told all I'm good for is child support, because I'm a dependent and my mother just wants the money. I wonder if I killed myself if she'd even get anything anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I'm saying, I guess. I just want to die. I am so bored with this life, I wish I was dead already."	1
"Had shotgun off safety, in my mouth today.I'm a targeted individual.  I've been tortured, followed (from city to city), slandered, attacked by every conceivable mental torture possible.  Hearing voices, seeing holograms, robbed of intellectual and physical property.  Too long to list.

Add to that my family always being assholes to me because they think I'm crazy.  I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off.

My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me.

Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking.

My sister called the cops on me a few months ago for being suicidal and telling her off.  I got a felon with a gun charge.  They can give me 5 to 40 years in prison.  I'm not going back to fucking prison.  I've been before and can't stand being around convicts who actually belong there.

And nobody ever apologized or feels any remorse for the things they do to me.

So I was going to do it today but everyone was coming over tonight, I was trying to hurry but scared.  I heard a noise, looked out the window, and it was my mom coming home from church.

So I'm waiting until I know for sure one of my nieces or nephews won't be here when they find me.

I just tried to kill myself, but I backed out at the last secondI'm 19, I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, I think a lot of it stems from my mom abandoning me when I was younger. Around 7ish months ago I met a girl. I fell in love and I thought it was finally getting better. Two months ago we broke up. A week after that my grandma died. Around 30 mins ago I tied a bad around my head to off myself. I started to not be able to breath and at first I was okay with it. I was ready. But then I started to panic, I was scared and idk y. I cut the bag open what felt like right before I was about to pass out. I can't even off myself right. Maybe I'll use a gun next time. Why can't I even fucking kill my self right (this is a side account Bc one of my friends knows my main account)	1

I'm DoneEverything is horrible. I'm a broken mess. Everything that has gone wrong is my fault. I can't love myself. I can't tell anyone. I can't get help. I've fucked up everything so badly there's no hope in fix it. Time is an illusion. Life has no meaning. I've been battling my own death for 3 years. I'm a mistake. I'm a cosmic joke. I'm asexual. I can't do anything right. I'm non-binary agender. I can't do anything right. I'm bad and I know it's true. People try to help me an I push them away. I don't deserve your energy, because I'm a black hole. I'm tired all the time. I'm 19 and I failed my first year of college because I couldn't even get out of bed in the morning. Now I have debt. I have no job because I'm afraid of failing at that too. If I get a job and it goes horribly like everything else I wouldn't survive it. It's  lose-lose situation. I FAILED. It's over. People trusted in me. People believed in me. And I FAILED. I'm a speck, on a smudge, on a particle, on a grain of sand, on a beach, among billions of beaches, so what does anything matter anyway. I'm done. I wish I'd never been conceived. I'm gonna fix that mistake. Fuck this reality. I hope it was all a simulation, because then it might make sense why my life has been such a sick cosmic joke. Goodbye everyone who knew me, but never knew me. You know nothing about me, and maybe that's all by design. This is it for me. I've had the rope for years. I'm done. Life is suffering. I'm killing myself. It's finally happening.	1

"Fuck this life. Fuck trying. Created this account just to say goodbye.Long time redditor, and lurker in suicide watch.  I attempted suicide last year, pretty close to this time.  Thought my life was falling apart...ha!  I had no idea how bad it could get.

I'm about to be evicted.  I've lost out on two good paying jobs now.  My girlfriend lives in another state, and is struggling hardcore herself...and I can't even support her.

I have no family here.  I have no family within 2000 miles.  My ex wife won't even check on the kids, let alone give me child support.  she's too busy snorting her money up her nose.

I give up.  I have nothing to sell.  My vehicle is dying.  I have no support from anyone.  I just can't. I've failed at life."	1
"I can't go on any longerI'm so sick of this, so fucking sick of this. I actually hated my therapist and forced myself to see her because I'd get my medication and let it do its job. Stopped seeing her, I'll take someone else. She was cold and I felt like she really didn't give a fuck. I'll call my family doctor to see if he can prescribe me some stuff, because I had to stop my treatment. Ran out of pills.

So many bottled up feelings inside of me. I want to put them out, ALL of them. I feel like I'm falling apart day by day, my creativity is blocked despite having plenty of ideas, I just can't get to do them. I can't confess to my best friend because I'm afraid I might lose her friendship, especially since she's got a boyfriend. I left many of my old friends because those assholes left me right when I needed them, and despite talking it out with them, I can't fucking go back to them like I used to. I met new people, but I can't get myself to truly go towards them. I don't want this anymore. I don't want to trust people, and have them care more about the death of a fucking idol than about their depressed friend. 

The true reason why I'm currently seeing family is that I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid I might do something stupid if I stay in my dorm room. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's okay. Let me cry in their arms. Listen to me. I can't show this part of myself to people because depressed people like me become a huge pressure. They usually leave right after. One of my friends did, and it was the last time I came close to suicide. 

I'm sick in the head. I'm shattered inside. I feel things I have no right to feel. I'm a mess. A fucking mess."	1
I'm Done [m16]I've recently returned from a certain summer camp (which will remain unnamed so I don't end up hunted down and thrown in a padded room) and it was a generally good if not underwhelming experience, but it was the only thing I've cared about for the past year. Without that to look forward to my life is back to its typical aimlessness. I'm back to hating everybody I talk to and feeling only fleeting instances of an emotion that could only loosely be described as positive. I'm posting here because I'm too lazy to write a note and don't care enough about anyone to address it to them, so I felt obligated to let a few strangers on the Internet know. The shotgun is calling me.	1
can't see myself living in the next few monthsI don't want to take my own life as it'll cause extreme misery to my family, parents in particular, but I also cannot imagine living through the next few months, much less years... I hate thinking this way but sometimes I just wished I could be knocked down by a car or contract a life-threatening illness, basically cease to exist. I feel as if I'm a failed person/adult, who never really grew up or matured as everyone else did. I'm way behind my peers in terms of career, socializing and life in general. I lack confidence in everything I do, even in simple basic things. I don't understand how this life works and I feel like I never will. And I know that it won't make a difference to the world if I wasn't here anyway, their lives would probably be better off without the burden and trouble that is me.	1
"My friend told me she made a suicide noteMy friend had attempted suicide thrice this year.  I'm practically 1000 miles away from her and I can't go there to make sure that everything's OK.  I'm scared that after telling me her about her suicide note, she'll feel more compelled to carry it out. She's been my support system when I hit rock bottom and a reason for me to keep trying on living. I really don't know what I'll do if she dies. 

I don't know how to tell her she's a strong and beautiful person, that she's worth it, that I love her no matter how bad things get. It's hard to voice them out in messages and not sound like I'm just telling those as some other feel good compliments and I don't mean any of it. I can't make her call the national hotline because she absolutely hates making a phone call when she's crying, I can't force her to see a psychologist or go to a hospital because she couldn't afford it and I'm only making things worse to her financially. I'm so lost at what I'd do if she attempted again"	1

"My therapist cut me off and it’s got me suicidalI was seeing her pretty consistently this whole year, and I’ve been doing very intense work on my trauma.  However, I had a habit of not showing up to sessions sometimes due to my depression.  This whole year I was going consistently, and it’s helped a lot. 
In the past three weeks, I did not show up because my depression was going off the rails, and I had no energy. 

I was attempting to reach her the past few days to set up an appointment, and she finally got back to me telling me that she’s going to have to stop seeing me due to my inconsistency. 

I’m really crushed and just broken down because of this.  My suicidal thoughts and ideations have been increasing in intensity the past three months, but now I would say I’m at a 9.2/10 in terms of wanting to end it. I realized that I should’ve honored my appointments, but I just feel so damn worthless now that even my therapist cuts me off.

"No sleep in 4 days. Can't win. Can't not lose.I started coughing 4 days ago and haven't stopped.  Can't sleep, can't lie down, can't walk any distance at any pace, can only sit if I'm hunched over like a cocktail shrimp, and that only delays the coughing for about half an hour.  

Full throated coughing, abs spasming with pain, coughing so much it feels like I'm bleeding, coughing so much I throw up.  Went to the ER, got a fistful of scrips, got released at 11:00 pm.  Only 24-hour pharmacy doesn't network with my insurance and wouldn't fill scrips.  Had to wait until 9:00 the next morning for the one pharmacy my insurance DOES network with to open, and they don't carry the COUGH MEDICINE.  It won't arrive until Friday.

Meds haven't stopped the coughing.  Haven't SLOWED the coughing.  Wife said either she'd check into a hotel or I would; she refuses to stay in the same building a me because I cough so damn much that SHE can't sleep either.  

And now the hotel kicked me out because of noise complaints, because I'm coughing too much.

"I'm only 20 years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long.

I'm ""only"" (""only"" according to what people say) 20 years old, and even though I wouldn't say I feel ""old"" exactly, I'm always thinking about our finite youth, about ageing and our mortality. I can't get it out of my head.

A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they're 33, and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes, as a 30 year old, with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes. I'm inevitably miserable in these pictures.

I see people I like, admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises. I'm **extremely** scared of ageing, you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me. I'm scared of regrets, I'm scared of ending up a nobody, I'm scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally.

I can't stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future. I feel so much guilt when I'm not 100% efficient in what I'm doing. I feel so bad about myself, my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying. I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty, I hate myself for being too weak. I really REALLY want this thing but I'm so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can't pull through. I want it so much that I want to cry. It's more like a necessity than a mere desire.

The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating, but having to do the work exhausts me *emotionally*. I know at least one of the reasons why this happens (meaning perhaps there are others), but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, let alone publicly. The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my ""dream"", why I want it, and why it's so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.

It's not a crime or anything like that, but it's something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).

One of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won't find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don't achieve my dream at least partially or if I don't achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of ""enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are"". Time itself is part of the ""specifications"" of my goal.

30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn't feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can't. I've already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so ""ambitious"" or ""demanding"" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I'm just a spoiled kid who hasn't grown up yet and learned of life.

Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can't be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don't know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.

That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want, but yea, as you see, it's kind of stupid."	1

"I want to liveI am 32 and I live with my parents, I Dont even have the option of moving due to their health and me not being able to support myself. I attempt to get jobs but people do not like me. My ex who I loved body and soul broke up with me five years ago. She gave me hpv and herpes....she was sleeping around and everyone knew but me. I reacted.....poorly. I said things on Facebook, mentioned her having an abortion, contacted her friends, and generally became pretty creepy about the whole thing. 

      Not a day goes by where I wouldn't give anything just for her to speak to me, even to call me the shithead I am. She wont , not one word in five years, can't blame her.

Now, I am afraid to even find anyone else, I feel tainted and unworthy. 

I have avoided doing well in school or work my entire life, I have a pretty decent IQ but all that does is give me fucked up thoughts of despair and meaninglessness. 

I suck at writing. 

When I'm happy people want to be near me, but I never am. I spend my days smoking pot, caring for my ailing father, mother, and a kid they adopted for whatever reason. I can't even kill myself because if I did she goes to cps and gets placed in foster care. I like her enough and she's a good kid. I just can't do it. I am not up to this task.

My health is failing me in multiple ways. Developed allergies to wheat, tomatoes, fruits, rice, onions.....lots of plants. All I can eat is corn, oats, meat and potatoes, as far as I can tell. It isn't the type of allergy that will kill me either, imagine rolling around in fiberglass and feeling that way for two days or so after anything on the bad list. It sucks I hate it. I get frequent headaches and always think I'm dying, but I really do feel like shit except no one believes it, they think I'm nuts, again I can't blame them. A lot more but I'm tired of writing.

Just looked at the ex's FB pic, she is beautiful as ever. I hope her life is happy. I know I could never have brought it to her. I bet she isn't alone today. 

Tldr I sit around avoiding life, and I can't kill myself because it would make someone's life a living hell."	1
"Honestly why do I put up with this existenceSo many things have happened in my life lately that just pushes me to ending it all.

My drug addict sister who abused our parents, is in and out of the hospital and had a baby with severe health issues due to her drug use that has now been pushed on to my mom.

Finals and mediocre grades. Im years from graduating even though I should have graduated this year.

Financial debt that got mostly racked up from school and letting a boyfriend take advantage of me.

Im still not over being in an abusive relationship 2+ years ago. And my most recent ex didn't take me seriously because I was in an abusive relationship, so that opened old wounds.

I fell madly in love with someone who is terrible for me (again). I broke it off with him but thinking about going through life without him makes me feel so alone.

Honestly, life hasn't gotten better. I've just gotten used to disappointment, grief and loneliness.

I'm think I'm finally going to kill myself by the end of the year. "	1

I hate this world so muchI wish I could just create my own planet and live on there. I'm so sick of people. I do not want to live anymore. I mean I want to live but NOT ON THIS PLANET. No matter what I do people will always treat me like shit. It's like once you have been bullied in highschool you are deemed to be the victim for the rest of your life. Because that's how your brain has been wired. It knows no better than to be the victim - even after highschool - in any situation. My life feels like I'm stuck in playing a shitty game day after day over and over again. And always the same shit happens. It's like a vicious cycle - you think you grow as a person and you're not in the same position you were 5 years ago but you always realize that you' re still a loser. Why can't there be a button that will just end it all? Is that too much to ask for? :/	1

Can't believe I'm here againI was well for a good while. A little over a year. Now, I'm back where I started, just wishing I were dead, having thoughts of slitting my throat or hanging myself but knowing I don't have the ability to do either properly. It is all the more painful having known what it felt like to be well. Trying to work has been like swimming through thick mud. I don't want to eat, and when I do, it makes me feel sick. Feeding and walking my dog feels like a monumental task. I don't want to shower. I don't want to get out of bed in the morning. I don't know for sure, but I suspect I have ADHD. I work in an office job, and it has been a mighty struggle, even in good times, to stay on task.  An actual 8-hour day of work generally takes me 11 hours to achieve. Obviously, I'm not supposed to work that way, but I can't help it. I feel chained to my desk. I feel overwhelmed. I know I am lucky to be employed, but it feels tenuous and like I'm fooling everyone. How much longer can I really expect to pull this off?	1
"I don't know...where to turn so I'll write here. I've have had thoughts of wanting to die before and admitted it at my last appointment to my pshychologist. 

I'm really trying to make myself think that I'm not suicidal? Does that make sense, probably not. Like it isn't valid. My thoughts of wanting to die doesn't feel valid? 

Like sure I've thought of it and I have the way I would do it layed out in a mental plan but I've never made any steps ""irl"" to complete that plan like buying the stuff or so on. 

So in my mind it's not suicidal thoughts? But isn't it?

I got  new meds a couple of days ago and one of the first thing I did was start to think and look up how many I would have to take to actually die, I don't think I would, but I want to and now know how to. 

Sry for a messy post, I'm just rambling at this point, just needed to write it down somewhere, anywhere so it isn't only in my head."	1
Thoughts of suicideI (23F) don’t know really, I’ve been touched by the darkness from a very young age - maybe 11 or 12 and I’ve been fighting the urge to end it all for just as long. I think I’m finally at the end of my rope so to speak, my world has completely crumbled in more ways than one and I don’t think there’s much reason left for me to continue to pretend I want to be alive. I wish I could say that things get better but they’ve only gotten progressively worse... 	1
"A Hopeless LifeI.... im a 13 years old kid, i know you might think i was some sort of emo or troll or anything.. but i just really need to get this out of my chest, so i live in indonesia, i'm a student last week i have a finals that will indicate if i was going to stay in my grade or goes up from my grade(im so sorry for my bad english) but the problem is my school uses some kind of server to store the grade, i studied really hard i even stay up late just to study and memorize, the first day i was confident, i answered every question it was easy, i check every number from 1-50 until i was sure im gonna get an a, so i press ""send"" and i wait.... Until 1 or 2 minutes later i got an F and no im not making this up, and looks like i will not make it to the next grade, my family was very strict my parent put a lot of trust in me and looks like im gonna dissapoint them... again, look i know im a dissapointment so don't waste your time telling me that in the reply, i just dont know, i know that my family are gonna take all of my facilities including my PC which i use to Write novels,making a 3d models and edit video, Basically my hope for survival, i know this world is a harsh place, and i can't stop what i was doing with my PC or i will end up a beggar, and if i did not make it to the ninth grade i will lose all my friend, love from my parent, and maybe even my sanity, so looks like suicide was the only way i could escape, or maybe not, i don't know, I Just Wanna Die"	1
"A needle full of bleach...So I guess it's like this.

Finally got to quit being homeless 6 months ago.  Already lost my job and don't know or understand how to handle living real life in a real house.  It's harder to come back from than I'd ever thought possible.  I have no food, my state won't fund me food stamps, I don't talk to ANYONE outside of the internet, including my roommates, who were at one point great friends of mine and helped me get back on my feet in the first place.  The girl I want to marry gave me a second chance when I got back into a place to live, and I've already crippled my chances at anything long lasting through paranoia and fear.  I won't be able to pay my rent in a week, and although they said they'd cover my share this month so I can keep looking for work, I don't think I can take the embarrassment of feeling useless and I also can't face life on the streets anymore.  I'm deep in the red with debt and I owe bad people in a city near home money from my old long since kicked drug habit, however, I've been thinking about using constantly lately. (It dominates my thoughts.)  I've been in bed for almost two days straight crippled with depression and don't know what to do.  I can't even look anyone in the face without wishing they'd beat the living shit out of me for being such a piece of trash.

I saved a needle from when I used as a reminder, always, that I could beat drugs.  Now it's sitting there, full of bleach, like it has been for the last 3 days.  And it looks better and better every time I look at it.  I don't know what to do.  I don't.

I really don't know what to do."	1
"I have HSV1. I really contemplating ending my life tonight.I did everything right. I was in a long term, monogamous relationship. We both got tested before having sex. Except they don’t test for HSV, and my ex didn’t tell me he got cold sores. I ended up contracting HSV1 genitally after a year of being together. He broke up with me in December and is now in a new relationship. He can be happy and feel love again. He cheated on me and has cheated on his current girlfriend. But he’s still a desirable person because he has HSV1 orally. 

I’ve been left tainted, and disgusting. I am now destined to live a life without sex, or love. I read posts on Reddit and I’m reminded over and over how I’m worthless now because I have a permanent STD. I was also so careful with sex, I’ve never had a one night stand. And yet my life is over. There is no point in living if I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life. "	1

i wish i could get hit by a busmy life is just awful. i have virtually no friends and i don't even think they care about me. the one true friend i had blocked me on everything because i hurt her because some of my ex friends set me up while drunk. my family never pick up on signs i give to them  and seem to not care about me either. it feels like if i killed myself tomorrow no one would even cry. I have been feeling like this for a long time the only thing which kept me doing it was the arrangement i had with a friend that if one of us died the other one would killed them self now that i am not friends with her any more  so no one would miss me i just don't see the point in living anymore its to painful	1

"I fantasize about suicide.I don't think I would ever put my family through the pain of me committing suicide, but I think about it a lot. I see things and think about how I could be killed by it. Cars, trains, electric tracks, guns, pills... etc. Some days/weeks are worse than others. But sometimes the first thing I think of when I wake up is ending my life. Honestly, I'm hoping for a terminal disease. Best of both worlds, won't have the guilt of fucking my family, and it would be my ticket off of this planet.

On bad nights, I come here and just read. It helps, and I just wanted to thank you all for the support you offer to complete strangers."	1
"Literally everythingWhy does everything trigger suicidal thoughts.  Every little thing. It also doesnt help that everyones main go to joke is that they want to kill themselves. Like just now for instance, my friend stating that they would like to kill themselves as we have math for 3 hours today. Everything is such bullshit.  

They need to make killing yourself easier. It takes too long to hang yourself and I pussy it too quickly. Fucking bullshit."	1
I'm not sure I'll make itI've gotten close to killing myself in the past, but I'm so afraid that I'm not going to make it through this week or the rest of the month. I feel like I'm walking on thin ice and about to plunge through. I've had a lot going on in my life. I should be using this time to figure out who I am, but I don't know who I am anymore. I only see what I've become. And that means I'm a toxic asshole that just causes pain to everyone around me. I've failed the people that I love. I'm not sure if I can keep going knowing what I've done or who I've become.	1

"I'm mentally deficient and I refuse to live with it.Hi, I'm Steve. I'm 17, I live with autism and mental deficiencies, and I'm going to kill myself right after I submit this god damn post.

I'm not posting this because I want help. I'm posting this because these words need to go somewhere, and honestly I don't know of a better place where a message like this would be acceptable.

Back to the subject. I'm autistic, and I have some really bad mental deficiencies and it's fucking killing me on the inside. I took a cognitive test when I was 15. I have an IQ of 77, and I was ranked either ""Deficient"" or ""Borderline Deficient"" on everything. Fuck. It's so hard living with the fact that your limits are so fucking low compared to the rest of the general population and you will never fucking be able to achieve your dreams because of some bullshit that I can't fucking help.

I'm in the special education program at my school and I fucking hate it. They teach jack shit and group me with kids that screech and shit their pants. I can talk normally, I just don't want to unless I'm asked. I'm mentally fucking deficient but I want to be taught something that's above preschool level. I've tried telling my mom it's not enough for me but she just dismisses me and tells me I won't make it in mainstream education. I try telling my special ed teachers I want more, but they dismiss me too and then make jokes about me behind my back like I can't fucking hear them. Hey, Mr. Janssen, when you read this, fuck you. I heard every little bit of shit you talked about me. Mrs. Huang, fuck you. I heard you call me inbred. Ms. Baker, fuck you too. I get it, I'm not smart and I never fucking will be but I want to be taught more than fucking preschool shit. Fuck.

I'll say it again: you have no fucking clue how hard it is to live when you know that your limits are much much lower than the average person, you will never graduate high school, you will never go to college, and you will never get any respectable job, and generally your life will be very unfulfilling. I always dreamed of being a coder, but guess what? That requires you to be smart and guess who isn't smart? Me. I tried to teach myself. It doesn't click and while I love it I'm so fucking bad and it takes me hours to figure out things that are ""super basic"". I can't do it. It's too hard.

I'm not willing to live a life in which I can't be a normal person. I just want to graduate high school, go to college, get a good job, and just have a normal life. But all of that has been made inaccessible by the fact that I'm in fucking special ed and won't even graduate high school and will forever be dependent on my parents.

I don't want to burden my parents any more by being the dead weight piece of shit that I am. And I don't want to doom myself to a life of suffering.

I hope you all can now sympathize with me.

Goodbye."	1
Gc Paranoia So Ill get straight to the point. Im in a gc with 4 people that we use for a class we all have together.

"Facebook friendI have a girl on Facebook. We have never really met or talked much, but she seems like a great person. Recently she has been posting statuses eluding to being depressed and “ending it.” Stuff like “I’m going to throw a death day party. No crying, just love” and “I know how I’ll do it” and stuff. I’ve reached out to her on messenger and asked if she was okay and stuff. She said she broke up with her bf and life was rough lately. I told her she could vent to me and I was there to talk but she didn’t really say much after that. 

I’m not sure what to do- I don’t know how to help. I’m considering talking to the police about her wellness, but I’m not sure if that’s the right decision. 

Any advice?"	1
"In a BoxI'm already dead, my body just hasn't caught up to the fact yet. 29, single, jobless/careerless, can count my ""friends"" (people who feel pity for me) on one hand, thousands of dollars in debt, living in a shit hole apartment, ugly, and have 0 social skills. I wish someone would walk up behind me and shoot me in the back of my head. I'm thinking of joining the military but I'm afraid of only getting maimed and not killed. I can't kill myself because I don't have the willpower, so instead I exist in a colorless limbo, waiting to die. Every second I'm alive literally feels like an eternity of suffering. I'm fully aware how cheesy that sounds, but it's the truth. I feel a thousand years old."	1
"The bare-minimum lifeDon't leave the house. Don't talk to anyone. Don't take care of yourself, or the place you live in (at least to an acceptable level). Cry at everything, or be unable to summon the tears when you need them. Spend all your time in escapism. Lose touch with reality. Forget how you used to be. Partake in all of the self-damaging behaviours. Quit them, just to swap to another and cycle back again in a few months. Your old friends hate you. Your family blames you for everything. Every single day seems wasted and is all too painful.

This is not a call out to anyone, or a guide or pity party, I am looking at my own dogshit life and crying. This is what I have reduced myself to, through my own faults and actions (or lack thereof), and my illnesses. 

The pain is so horrible that self-immolation seems like an okay option right now. 

But seriously, it does not seem like I can get off this ride anymore. It's full steam ahead to a bottomless pit of suffering unless I throw myself off. I'm at a loss and like many other people, I am lonely and alone. Honestly I don't know, or understand, who would choose life."	1

hello, i've been struggling a lot with my mental health lately and i've tried to look for a person to reach out to but i can't.i'm 15 now, i've been having issues with my emotional and physical health since the last 2 or 3 years. lately it's becoming really hard for me to be strong and not fall apart. i've been crying a lot too. even though it helps a bit, i just feel very empty. i can't properly explain the feeling. my physical health is also detoriating, i'm currently on medications for kidney stones and i feel very tired ( probably because of it). i don't have any friends that i can talk to about this.	1

So why do so many people fake it for attention I was this close to hanging myself I could feel my heart stopping but the rope snapped, even though I had rope burn for 2 weeks and my eyes were fucked everyone said I did it for attention...Fuck you if you fake it for attention because of you I can't get help for this problem and I may Aswell finish the joke FUCK YOU seriously if you do this because your ego needs attention.	1

Another failed attempt would just me humiliating at this point, nobody fails three times if they really want to die.  

I wish I could see a way to feel better through therapy, but I can't.  I've been trying for 7 years, with many different doctors and specialists and medications and treatments.  I've tried giving it 110% and putting in solid effort.  It doesn't work. It doesn't improve.

"I just called a crysis hotline, what a waste of time and tearsI don't want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare.

so ya don't wreck my life and find out who i am. 

I just called a crysis hotline, and it was busy, lol and I called 5 more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times. then I found another line for some local crysis centre.

i used to work as a telephone surveyer, it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone, just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell. special one time offer! how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you.

actually that sounds terrible, I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can't see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem. so basically I am alone, I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares.

it's all up to you she says, wow what a thing to say to someone with depression, yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me, i know that my life is either shitty or it isn't based off my actions. I very much know that. why would I be depressed if I didn't blame myself? just fucking terrible, now I'm just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal.

it's like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house... well I work fulltime so that's not gonna work, and I don't have vacation days, and I work nights, so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever. well that's not really gonna work if I get up at 8-10pm and go to bed at noon-2pm

so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life, I actually don't mind my job, I actually like it there, it's the one safe spot in the world is work. I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat, I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since. but I know it's not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems. then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all, and then it's just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house, but why don't I just move out? well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn't work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I've maxed out my credit cards paying them rent(which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out.) I didn't even ask them to change their habits, I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it. this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying. have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog? and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter, just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration.

so now I'm stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt. I'm not even hopelessly in debt, I just can't leave here, but I can't live being this fat anymore, because nobody will love me, or even even affectionitly touch me, I don't even mean sex, I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female. you know I don't even blame them for regecting me anymore, they all actually out of their way nice to me

so ya whatever I guess, I'm taking some art classes, and I found out I'm very talented, lol I'm a very honest person in a way that's great on camera. But I'm fat and people don't have sympathy for fat people(well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss) if you just try to put them in a normal life situation, people inheritly react negatively, because fat people are ugly, I think it too

but ya I can't fix it. I know people won't accept this statement, but when I'm on my ""healthy diet"" I feel great and am not hungry because it's well balanced and not extremely low calorie. But I come home from work and it's just there is food and sugar everywhere, and as soon I get eating it, I want more and then i don't care because I think I've already fucked it up for myself, I might as well just eat more so I don't feel bad.

and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible, I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won't seem like unenjoyable effort. and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don't want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better. so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories, that's 1200 calories I can eat in I dunno. 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds. and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs. on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around. then all of a sudden I'm like 2000 calories over my needs and then that's evey day, and that's like all in the last 3-4 hours of the day. and the next day maybe I just don't care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks. and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash.

 it's just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me, they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself. but if I ever try to just anything, just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction. I know we're in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don't hate me, because I act like I think you hate me, but it's not because you hate me, it's because I love(yes I know I don't know what the word means but I like to use it) you and you'll regect me and it's easier for me to perceive it as hate, and you go out of your way to say it isn't and you care that little bit. and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it's just this natural reaction and attraction, no desperation, there isn't time to get desperate and you just say ""I'm gonna play it cool and later maybe do something."" and then you get home and you remember, I'm almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she'll regect you like everyone else because you've done that, that same thing has happend dozens of times and you've played it out like groundhogs day, where you've done every possible thing, reacted everyway, tried everything(including not trying) and it has all ended the same.

you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I'm actually in pretty good shape, I'm just really really fat, I lifting and flexibility and I cycle(even though it's really hard being so fat). and I got down to I'm 6'2 220 which the lightest I've been in ever,  even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage, the first time I've been under 30bmi since I've remember checking my weight. and now in 5 months I've thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose, and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food(mostly it was always an  issue, always adding a few hundred calories here and there). and now it's like you can sell everything you own, get your debt to a controlable level and move out, but I have to move walking distance from work, because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work, after they moved and took me with them, it was a mistake to move out with them, but I would have no car and I couldn't take my art classes, or even have access to a gym because there isn't one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there.

so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in(thin ice around some shores), and I'm not tryhing to violate the rules,  it's just it seemed like a good idea, I was just gonna jump and swim to shore(if I could make it) and that seemed like a good idea. then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something, I dunno, it seemed lik,e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone. but whatever I'm really tired now and I just want someone I dunno. there is nothing I know nobody can help me, the things I want that will make me happy I can't ask and don't have any right to ask. but crying makes me tried and I don't like having to hear myself, crying wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to hear the whale, it's like someone else, it's like I'm hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me.  I'm just thinking wrong, reacting wrong, I just don't interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over, or go to therapy for.

and all of this will start over again tomorrow, but it'll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I'll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I'll be happy, that's what I have to look forward to. the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible."	1

My nervous system is f***ed...I have Sciatica and it’s another problem on my list of reasons of why i should die. I don’t even want treatment because it’s not worth it honestly. I’m soooo fucked emotionally and I physically it doesn’t even matter anymore	1
Is death comforting?No,please don't invoke my family or any friends,or any sense of love,or any sense of duty,or any sense of morals.Or that 'it will get better' or 'it is not worth it'. No. It can't be borne anymore. It can't.	1
"I wish someone would push me in front of the train or subway cars.I go on the train and subway everyday. I want someone to push me one day or bump into me accidentally. A woman was standing so close behind me today as the train pulled in that I thought she might actually do it. I was scared but excited too. I'm too scared to actually jump in front of the rails by myself. 
One of my closest friends stood in front of the GO train earlier this year and killed herself. It sounds sick but I was jealous."	1
"I want to do it tonightI'm broke and about to graduate college if i can finish my thesis. this whole adventure was a waste of time. I only have one friend really. I don't have any food and my parents hate me. i have a job but i won't get paid for two weeks and it'll be like 50 dollars. No money for may rent. I'm trans and I don't have money to pay for my hormones or my treatment, and I still haven't come out to my friends. I think I'm going to kill myself tonight. I've been thinking about it for a long while. I've been keeping myself alive knowing that i'd upset the people who love me if i do it, but now i just resent them for making me be alive.
I should have done this a long time ago. The only thing scaring me now is that I don't want to hurt anyone. A few years ago my friend killed himself and this boy who found the body looked really messed up every time i saw him after that. I'm afraid someone will have to deal with me, and my housemate will have to deal with my empty room. These are the only reasons I am still alive today."	1

"My mom is a shopaholic and I'm so over it. I didn't know what else to call her besides shopaholic, she doesn't go shopping for random things. She buys specific things and her latest kick is Starbucks cups. I absolutely despise it because she'll complain about not having enough money for important things, like my braces or food, but will then go onto facebook and buy a bunch of cups that are around $100-$50. It may be even more than that but that's just what I've seen. I've been alive for a phase like that where she would buy leggings from lula roe. She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time. I think she only does it to deal with stress, but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it shouldn't be berating me or my sisters either. This whole thing just reminds me of how much I dislike my mother because of how horrible she is, I would get into it but this post is just mostly about how annoyed I am and stressed out I am that's shes wasting all this money on cups she'll never use. My family has thought of doing an intervention but we never act on it because we know she'll never listen and just pretend to be the victim. I hope this phase ends soon, so I dont have to hear her complain about not having money but then spend about $1,000 on cups.


Long story short, my mom going through phases of buying specific things to release stress while also complaining about having no money."	2
How do I make homemade poison. (F 14)I want to sleep and never wake up again. My mom wouldn't have to spend her money on 5 people ever again. She wouldn't have to waste her money on tax for someone who can't even focus right to do their summer school work. One less fatass to take care of who's too attached to people. One less failure in the world. I wouldn't be an annoyance to my siblings any more. I wouldn't have to face my social anxiety. My friends wouldn't have to worry about me. I don't want them to feel upset about me leaving. I just wanna die. None of my hobbies are making me feel happy. I just want to be happy, without a care in the world.	1

I'm heavily suicidal and depressed, I just want to end it all.I am a former sex worker with ptsd, borderline personality and major social anxiety that has stemmed from having withdrawn and burnt bridges with all my friends over the last couple of months. Living has no purpose,  this world is so sad and depressing and I have no motivation to finish uni and work for the rest of my life. I can't even sleep properly because I'm woken up by the slightest noise and ruminate on everything bad I've done and that's happened to me.  The love of my life is dating someone else and my anger and personality disorder ruined that relationship.  I have no friends and I live at home with my depressed mum and depressed brother. I can't get out of bed anymore and when I do,  it's only to binge eat and then go back to bed. I dont listen to music or do anything interesting, I am a shell of my former self. I'm so suicidal, please help.	1
"Lost my job this morningSorry in advance for my lack of cohesion and my stream-of-consciousness way of writing this all down. 

I was fired from my job in customer service this morning, an all-time low. I couldn't stand waiting for rude people to call me while sitting in front of my computer for 8 hours a day and it has been depressing me terribly this past year (only been working in cs for a year). Maybe part paranoia, but I felt like it was treated like the lowest position in the company (SaaS type company, ~100 employees) and frankly I was embarrassed of it. I hated every day and although I'm not dumb enough to ever quit a decently paying job, I'm ostensibly not above being largely inconsistent in my work there due to my internal struggle with where I am as a 30 year old. I hated it and couldn't ever keep up a charade for long. 

Full disclosure, I've had suicidal ideation for approximately 15 years. I survived an attempt when I was 14 and professionals will tell you it's increasingly common for repeat attempts to occur in the wake of the attempt. In spite of all of this - I've beat the odds, graduated college, landed a pretty great job with my degree in 2011 but screwed it up and ended up being fired after a year and a half. I was out of my league (not really an unexpected thing when post-college) but my pretty rigid defense mechanism that I've had these past 15 years caught up with me. I have a propensity the be highly critical of those around me, as well as myself. I can do a 180 at the drop of a dime on how I feel about someone. I guess you could say I'm a pretty emotional little guy, internally.

My parents divorcing after around 34 years have contributed to my emotional state, this happened maybe 2 years ago. I was very much in the middle of it and they both ended up being (what I consider to be) immature, dishonest and manipulative towards me. At the end of it all, they both moved out of state. My family outside of them has been pretty much zero, partially my fault (embarrassment after my attempt, too). Suffice to say, Christmases throughout high school consisted of just them and me and sometimes my one sister (whom ran away at the age of 17 to be with her current husband).

Also of note, my parents were rich growing up, and you could probably say I had a silver spoon in my mouth for most of my life. MANY extravagant vacations when I was young and pretty much through college. I've seen a lot of very beautiful things and had it very easy for a lot of my life. Which is why I'm even more willing to let go of all of this. My life isn't going to get any better and I don't mean to drone on too much with my narcissism but I've just had it. I've had a lot of great memories that I'm able to smile about. I've been fortunate enough to fall head over heels in love with and date a girl during 3 years of college so at least I know I've truly lived. I just don't ever want to make the mistake of having children that have this same depressive affinity that I do. 

These last 15 years have been so volatile for me, I don't think I'll be able to do another 15. It's most assuredly fucked up how often I think of suicide, I know that. But I've survived 15 years feeling this way... 15 years of introspectively daydreaming of suicide....as an easy out type fantasy, as a realistic look of the world and it's brevity...my brevity.

I just want advice. I've done therapy and it opens pandora's box. I tried celexa for a year, two years back, and it turned me into a hypermanic mess.

The only thing that makes me happy is music. I can sit at a piano and improvise beautiful compositions off the cuff. It's catharsis for me to stave my loneliness at times. Sometimes I'll play for an hour straight, and just start crying midway because of how much I keep inside. It does help, though.

I know this all may seem quite pathetic and obvious in terms of an answer to you guys, but I just had to get this out. I still feel godawful at the moment but better than when I started.

Someone please give me words of advice."	1

"Why do people put on the sarcastic voice? Adding tone to sarcasm sucks all the dryness out of it. For example, if you had a resting neutral face and said ""Wow, that's amazing. I'm ecstatic."" That's dry. It's witty. If you were actually acting ecstatic and throwing on a ""this is blatent sarcasm"" tone, it just comes across as trying too hard and the sarcasm falls flat."	2

19, Queer, and pointlessI've been struggling with these thoughts since middle school and each year they only seem to get worse. Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've  tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine. My name is Zairen and I use they/them pronouns. I'm a 2nd year Csci student, a DJ Training Director, and my time is coming to an end.	1

"I'm a broken, unlovable person.I found out today I lost a friend because they had romantic feelings for me. I'm devastated to say the least. But I came to the realisation that im a broken, unlovable person. I have severe trust issues, I cannot ever get into a romantic relationship because I just cannot trust. I will fear they will leave or cheat on me. Now I'm second guessing all of my friendships. Maybe they don't really like me. Maybe they'll break up with me, and im just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. 

I will never find someone. I just cannot. Not even a friendship, they always fail. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just keep getting hurt. There must be something severely messed up with me that I just can't seem to figure out. There will never be someone. I can't do this anymore. Everyone leaves me, everyone hurts me. I don't understand what I did wrong."	1

"Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven’t made a post like this before, but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such. Right now, I’m not doing well and I’m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won’t scare and worry my friends and family.

I’ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety (now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis) one month ago. My post isn’t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around.

My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night. Now, Some of my best friends got married  this week where my ex was the maid of honor. I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day.  (many advise no on the friends with the ex, especially in this situation, but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up). I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner, and just want my friendship that I have/had with her to remain. I don’t have many friends left around me. 

The night before their wedding, I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn’t say much more than that. My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me, and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder. (They don’t understand it, and Don’t believe I am and think I’m chasing something that doesn’t exists) . The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding, being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to. But I wasn’t able to.

I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself, but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding. (Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do) And told her I don’t think being friends will ever work. I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home. I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding. (My friends and fraternity brothers). 

All this is too much for me right now; with the added fact I’ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family. I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don’t find meaningful or fulfilling. And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love. I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole. I know now that it’s a problem I need to work on.

I’ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little. I don’t know how they feel, but I can imagine it hurts, is frustrating and an annoyance they didn’t need. 

I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself, That it would magnify the pain I’m feeling and put it on to them. I’m just so unstable right now even on medication, therapy, and exercise. I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don’t want to burden them. I’m just so afraid, and lonely right now. I don’t want to die, but death is looking more and more favorable. I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away. 

To anyone that reads this, thank you."	1

"My step father is repeatedly telling me that he's going to divorce my mother because of him having to provide for me. I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.

Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.

Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).

He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""

I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.

Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.

I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.

I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 

I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.

I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

I don't want consoling words...I want a way out...and I think there's only one here. I can't handle the sight of everybody I know having their life fall apart because I can't push myself to lift a finger."	1
I can’t find any good friends that will help me in life One of my friends just now was continuously roasting me about how ugly I am and how I cannot get girl, and ny friends just laughed and said “Ooohhhhhh” like I don’t know what to do man. I want to kill myself because I’m ugly	2
People are so mean. Why must I be so sensitive in this world.I am so sensitive. I cry easily. I am emotionally affected by everything almost. I hate it. I have anxiety and can't talk to people. I can't handle aggression at all. I don't want to be here. The world feels so cold, cruel, and distant. I feel like a scared deer alone. 	1

Why did I wake up this morning?Why can't I just die in my sleep already? I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. 	1
"Wish I'd just do itFor every day that passes, my wish to die gets more intense. If I had a magic insta kill pill on me now, I'm not sure I'd say no.

I don't have the guts to do it. I'm too afraid of regret if I do anything drastic. That's why I constantly wish I'll die suddenly and unexpected, out of my control. I'd be so contempt with that. Every time I go to sleep I hope I don't wake up. Passing away while dreaming is a dream.

Life would be so great if I could make all my problems go away, but, as everyone knows, life is not that simple. So I want to die. I don't want to face my problems. 

My life is going nowhere. I'm a bad person. Every waking moment when I'm not distracting myself with Reddit or video games, I am wishing I was dead. I hate myself so much. I wish I never existed. I don't want to live my life anymore because it's fucking terrible.

I'm sorry, family. I don't know how much longer I'll keep putting this off, but eventually I hope I'll do it. When I absolutely have had enough and I can't distract myself any longer. I want to do it so bad."	1
"I want to die - fastI can hear my heart beating through my ears right now. today was pretty bad, I wont go into details but in short, got up at 10, did something nice, then prepared to get on with my day by going somewhere till my mum started a fight, she left and i grabbed a bottle of wine (btw im 15 i shudnt even be drinking) and drank it. then mum caught me and told me that the bottle of wine was extremely expensive and didnt belong to us. I drank a sip as i was about to get drunk but didnt

i dont know what to do because i took a sip and im scared what the wines owners will say about it as it was expensive and they are friends on my mum.

help? I want to die but my mum took the wine away and knives, I want to over dose but last time I did that it failed and i was put into hospitals and shit and they didnt treat me very well and i think a law suit happened not too sure but it was seriously fucked up and it happened for YEARS only stopped last year and Ive been trying to go back into a normal life but I cant and I want to kill myself

my family is so damn FUCKED, there all so messed up and I hate school, I hate myself, I dont have many friends and the friends I do have are all pieces of shit

"Is AP Lang really worth it? I'm a sophomore atm and need to decide what classes to take next year. I'm being recommended for AP Lang, however I'm not entirely sure I should take it.  It might just be the whole pandemic situation, but I'm really stressed right now with the classes I'm in already, which are all honors (except history, which I took over summer school) plus choir and Spanish.

I'm doing good in all my classes so far and I want to go to a good college, which is why I'm considering AP lang at all. But I'm scared it's going to be too hard.

Not only that, but  I plan to take AP Bio next year, which would require me to drop my favorite class, choir. Choir is really important to me and I'm very close with everyone there. I was originally planning to take English 3 over summer school, but now I'm not sure since I might take AP Lang.

I should also mention that I had an awful teacher for English in freshman year. I mean, she made me hate English and breakdown multiple times. She's also one of few AP Lang teachers.

Wow, lengthy. Sorry. Should I take English 3 over summer school for less stress and the ability to keep my favorite class, or should I drop choir and just suffer through AP Lang?

TL;DR I don't know whether I should drop choir to take AP Lang or if I should just take English 3 over summer school."	2

I honestly don’t know what to do with myself anymoreI’m 15 but I feel like my life is already over. I just want to fall asleep forever. My gpa went from average to completely nonexistent, I constantly push everyone away and struggle taking care of myself. I’m so exhausted. I try to tell my parent that but then he gets upset with me and says it’s because of the phone. I’ve wanted to kill myself for years now. I can’t get therapy, my parent doesn’t believe in it and frankly I don’t blame him. There was a point in my life where I was on so much medication because of a doctor that I ended up in the hospital. After getting out of an abusive household I don’t know how to function. All I think about is trying to kill myself. I end up forcing my emotions so much that I’m the end people try to stay away from me because I’m “fake”. I just don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to be alive. I want to kill myself so badly. I’ve tried to get help in the past but no one actually cared.	1

I finally have someone that cares about me which is all I ever wanted, so why does it make me even more miserable?Why is she so stubborn about keeping me around? I’m fucking worthless. Why can’t she just let me die? It genuinely makes me frustrated and annoyed. I just can’t figure out why she won’t give up on me and it’s literally driving me insane. I crave friendship, intimacy, and closeness. I begged every night to have someone in my life who would just give me a chance and wouldn’t give up on me. And I finally have that, but it’s an absolute joke. What a sick fucking joke that the thing I’ve wanted for years just makes me 10x more miserable. I’m worthless and I’m a lost cause I need to kill myself.	1
"The bad guy never wins.These days are heavy. Not only with doubt and self resentment, but with responsibility and worry too. Suicide isn't hard to think or imagine about, but the word is like poison to everyones ears. I have tried my whole life to escape the stigmatism of me being garbage, due to my parents bad choices. I have not succeeded. I don't think i ever will, because in every picture i am the bad guy. I help my siblings strive for survival in a world that WANTS us gone. The emotional drain is so severe that some days i wonder if this is real. I don't even need drugs or alcohol to have an out-of-body experience; I'm detached every day. This message might seem chaotic, i apologise, but so are my thoughts at this time.
I know that if i died this night, tomorrows sun would rise all the same and the world would turn with it. So why does this all seem so pointless? Why does it all seem so surreal at times?
I get that my life could be worse- or so I'm told. But i don't live those lives, i live this one.
And in this life the bad guy doesn't win."	1
"Everything is too much and I been sleeping poorlyI live in a bad situation, and there is no easy way out. I'm hungry, I'm poor, I'm tired, and I'm constantly getting sick.  I'm mad at myself and too tired to move. I want to skip work but staying home is worse because everyone here treats me like I'm toxic just for existing, and tries to convince me I'm bad and awful for expecting them to meet me even just a third of the way. It's so hard to fight back without becoming a nasty person too, and I feel like I'd rather just hang than work hard to own myself again. 

I'm so mad at myself that I got myself into such an awful situation, and I'm broken hearted that no one else I the apt will even try to get his resolved, so I'm going to have to get my roommates evicted or something instead of kindly letting them or me leave.

My hand is infected from trying to protect cats, and the antibiotics aren't working, and I can't find my cream and that makes me paranoid about all of this. 

Every time  I try to sleep I say I want to die. I want to break myself to pieces and die. I haven't slept more than 4 hours in days, and work is in four hours again. I feel like vomiting. 

I can't go to work, and I can't be safe in my house, so the best  option is death.

I know it is not but it is the only other option that gives me rest. 
I just hate it and everything is my fault, and I'm probably being terrible and selfish for wanting my home to be better for me and my cat. I only am alive for him so he won't eat me by accident.  I don't know how to take care of me anymore, I'm so trapped and I'm so scared to push.

I swear to god if one more person tells me to volunteer after opening up about my suicidal thoughts I’m going to shoot myself and hope they get splatteredI get it, I put on a good f*cking facade, people probably think I’m just being full of myself. I don’t open up to people but the few times I have (suicide hotline, ER) I get this advice. I get it, for someone who is just down in the dumps volunteering is awesome but for someone who constantly gives their all to other people it’s bullsh*t. Its like their last attempt at helping once they’ve gone through the list of things I’ve already fucking tried. Guess what, I have volunteered and I hated it it felt forced and I already have a hard time doing anything for myself so spending what little I have on more people makes me incredibly depressed. 	1

I'm dreading college I start my first day of senior year tomorrow (it's that dumbass zoom shit not real school), and I'm really dreading college. I get really homesick so I'm going to need to come home a ton but there's only 2 schools within biking distance that I'm applying to, and one of them is super competitive, and the other based of their subreddit is full of asshole boring kids. I also don't like the idea of college culture. I'm an accepting person, but I'm the type of kid to make pretty offensive jokes, and college kids are super sensitive about that. I also don't like the vibe where your expected to be mature, like I love being a kid. I feel like college kids are too serious and mature compared to high schoolers and I don't like that. I'm not too worried about making friends, but also like I'm barely halfway through puberty so I'm gonna look mad young. I also need to play a sport to occupy myself, and sense I'm not good enough to play varsity in college, I'd have to form some sort of club sport team which is a ton of work.	2
"Week 1 of grad school and I'm already a failureI started grad school last week. I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.

I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.

With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class. My other online class is fine, I have an A. But now thats my only class, which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I'm going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever. I'm never going to get my PsyD because I'm a fucking moron who can't manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this. Its almost 5am and I've been trying to calm myself down for the past 2 hours; I finally found this place to vent to. I hope that's okay. My cat is with me so I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm trying so hard to control myself but it's so hard, and I'm so tired."	1

She likes yellow, because it reminds her of happiness so I want to incorporate lots of yellow in it. She has been going through some stuff and I feel like she hates herself even more for it.

"Watching myself slowly die.I'm not even sure what to do anymore.  This isn't me.  This isn't my life.  I stopped taking my meds today.  I don't want to get better anymore.  What was I even trying for to begin with?

I’m only 27 and I married the wrong man.  I don’t love him.  We are not compatible.  I tried to leave him before and start a new, but he tried to kill himself and begged to come back.  I cut off all ties but he found me anyway.  I took him back and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  Now were married.  I refuse to procreate with him.  I’m not dragging other human life into my misery.  He says he loves me and he cares, but his insecurities and esteem make it impossible for us to coexist.

His debt is following me.  They found my number.  Collectors call every day.  I answered the call one time because I did not realize that it was a collector.  My husband became extremely upset with me for answering the call.  He said that I made everything worse because they know how to contact us now.  I don’t answer my phone at all anymore.  He owes tens of thousands for student loans and he is pretending like they don’t exist.  He gets angry at me when I try to help.  I’ve given up on the subject.  It will be the ignored weight on our shoulders until the day I die.

My dog has fallen ill.  I have drained my account trying to save him, but now I am out of hope.  It breaks my heart seeing him lay on the floor not moving or eating anymore.  He is going to the vet one more time tomorrow.  Then I am taking him back to the shelter for good.

I have two cats.  I will ask a friend to watch them for a few days.  I need them to go to a good home and I will know that they will be happy with her.

I’m not even sure why I’m writing this down.  I’m not sure why I’m even posting this here.  I just needed to see it I guess.

"Hmm. I can't think of a good title that isn't generic. I'll say it's a normal suicidewatch wall of text.I'll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself.  If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen.

I'll try to be short and concise.  Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before.

Currently: age - 26, male, live alone with dog, no friends, one psychologist/therapist, diagnosed with- depression, ADHD, anxiety, type 1 diabetes 

Backstory: 6 years college - dropped out,  many psychologists and therapists, many different diagnoses,  choleric temperament - hard to work with, upper? middle class, white, extreme guilt of not living to potential

5 years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything.  I hated myself and everyone.  I was angry, frustrated and sad.  As the years progressed I became more isolated.  As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago.  I have no job, I dislike speaking to my parents, and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk.  I guess I also talk to my psychologist, he is the only one I have ever not hated.

It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change.  My parents have money, I am not in jail, and I am relevantly smart.  I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that, but it's not just that.  When I would get a job (a shitty one) I would become quickly bored.  I never last more than a month and usually I do something I'm not supposed to do before I quit - crash company's servers, make people angry at me ect.  I am told I have the potential to be smart, but then everything I do is wrong.  I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored.  

I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light.  There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can.  I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks, articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies.  Am I right?  I am sure I am not, though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine.

Anyway, I see my lack of motivation.  But it isn't because I feel like I can't do things.  I have done things, but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over.  Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again.  

A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure.  If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out 100 until someone says yes, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is I am so extremely lonely, but the girls I see I hate.  I don't want a gf, I don't want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter, complete loneliness that I don't want either, but it is a lot easier to handle.  My majors in college became boring as I was studying them, I couldn't keep going on.  I always felt like I wasn't learning well enough. I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades.  I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times.  I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month.  

I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive.  My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help.  I worry about every pain and problem with my body.  I don't want to die, but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me.  There is this schism in me where I am cocky, independent, egotistical, unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence, needs babying, scared and obviously unoriginal.  There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place.  I don't trust anyone, not even myself, but then I judge myself by everyone's advice and what I believe.  When I am alone I wish I wasn't, and when I am with company I wish I was alone.  I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly.  I wish people would do stuff for me, and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing.  I get a gf, a job, a school and think immediately about leaving. 

Anyone who used to care about me, I think, has long given up.  Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to.  I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy.  I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn't do it.  They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself.  I can see how it makes no sense and yet, I still understand how both things I said were completely true.  

Holy shit.  What a wall of text.  I can't even TL;DR it because it still feels like I missed the point. 
**TL;DR** How do I stop being a white male, privileged little bitch?"	1
I think my neighbors were robbed Ok, here’s the story, this white van drove by me house at around 5 PM, the van looked familiar,  I then remembered, I saw that fan before noon today! I was confused, at first I thought they were coming home from work but I realized it was going the same direction, then it parked by my neighbors house, after presumably driving around the block for hours, I told my brother and he pointed out that the truck was the cable/internet company so they are probably just fixing their stuff, but this van had been driving around the neighborhood for hours. My brother kept a close eye on them and he said the two people in the van were screaming and flipping each other off, unprofessional for someone on the job, at one point they split up, one took a latter (cable not satellite, no need for a latter) to house A, and the other goes to house B (across the street) without a latter, he said the guy at house A was messing with its electrical box, then climbed the latter but he couldn’t see what he was doing based on his view, then he got down and went across the street to house B with the latter, he said they didn’t have any technical equipment with them either. He and I think that two of our neighbor’s houses were robbed, I told my mother but she didn’t believe me. I just don’t understand what cable company and would do two houses at once with a latter and have their employees flip each other off. Me and my mother made a bet to, there’s no prize but he still made a bet nonetheless. What do you think?	2
"Ivy League Essay Examples Hi Guys, 

I recently did some research on some of the best essays which got gained admission to different Ivy League Colleges. I believe it would help students get a sense of what works and what not so I put this all together in this article:

"Add an 😏 emoji to the end of any sentence and it becomes funny (in a sexual sort of way) So today I was bored and I sent a message with the wrong emoji at the end, and I realised this.

""Did you eat breakfast yet 😏""

Try it, any ordinary sentence becomes funnier if you add that emoji to the end. Let's all have a good laugh."	2

"I just want someone to know...I'm giving up.  

I've tried for years and years to fight through, but it's not getting any better and is getting worse.  If it wasn't bad enough to have several co-morbid mental illnesses, even my therapist admitted that my life seems to have a never ending stream of bad situations/events.

I've always had trouble making friends, but thought I had a couple I could rely on.  But I get screwed over and pushed away when I tried to open up about my depression and struggles. I can't say I blame them - I wouldn't be around myself either if I had the choice.

I won't have a job as of next week as they've had someone take over my duties...they didn't even tell me(although I knew it was coming), they just stopped putting me on the schedule.  

My bank account is in the negative and I've lost my health insurance.  I just had to move and there's no money for next month's rent, so I'm going to screw over the landlords who took a chance on me &amp; end up homeless anyways.

The only thing I want is someone who will tell me its OK to give up. To acknowledge that I have tried hard for years and years to work with my doctors and get counseling and change my life and its not getting better...it's worse.  I wish I had cancer or some other disease where death would be understandable when treatments aren't working and/or quality of life is poor.

I feel so ashamed that I'm a failure."	1

"I’ve lived long past my timeI’ve been contemplating suicide as long as I can remember 

I’ve done everything to get better, I got my diagnosis, and have been taking them for more than three months only to find out the best version of myself still sucks a lot. 

Last time I tried I was stopped because I left a note. This time I made no such mistake. I’ll be gone before my family comes home. I told a few of my friends some final words and my phone has been blowing up so I just turned it off. I scrubbed all of my presence on social media. It’s all done. I can finally go in peace. My first attempt was when I was 18, I’m finally succeeding. Honestly my life’s been going down hill from then anyway so it’s about time. I just needed to get my last word out without alarming any more people. It’s finally over. I’m glad I got to choose how I go. Goodbye"	1

"WelpI’ve never felt so close to going thru with it but this week is the last straw I’m afraid. It just gets worse and worse and it feels like I shouldn’t be depressed or anxious bc my life is great, but I still feel like I can’t go on. 
One of the only friends I have is also depressed, but he has his reasons (shitty childhood, drugs, all that). I texted him a couple days ago saying I was close to going thru with it, we texted a bit, and suddenly he stopped. Hasn’t checked in with me since. I can’t help but think if I’d actually gone thru with it even he wouldn’tve given a shit. People say there’s no where to go but up, but right I’m in the never ending abyss."	1
i really wish to feel happy again soon, i haven't been genuinely happy in like years i sweari really can't take living like this anymore	1
Is there actually any hope?Everything seems pretty pointless to me, absolutely pointless. There are things in the future that I should be looking forward to, and I should be excited about them, but I'm not really. The only thing I think that actually makes me happy anymore is attention sometimes, but even then it doesn't always. I'm also, spectacularly useless, and worthless. This is not something I'm going to argue about, they are facts. I don't even know if I really want to be useful to anyone anymore, I'm pretty selfish, on top of everything. Anyway, back to the main question, is there hope? What's the lowest you've been at that you manged to get back from? Can you change who you are as person, when narcissism seems to be all that makes up your identity at this point? And if you can't, do you deserve to even live then? If you know, that you're a horrible person, and you don't or can't change, do you have the right to live? I don't know if I do. I feel like maybe I don't. 	1

"This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved - part 4This has just happened to me today.

Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go ""bitch - pleeassseee""

Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them, self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger. 

It's not that I plan to kill myself, but instantaneously I think in my head ""I want to kill myself"" and immediately next thought I would think ""OMG don't be stupid, that's not going to happen"". That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up. It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent. 

The problem here is now I don't really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone. 

What happened today was I bitched to a ""friend"" at work (via my personal email and their work email). I do say ""friend"" because I'm not venting to them because it's my best friend or anything - it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work... and isn't very trustworthy (as you are about to find out)

I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment, which had bits of people are lying to me again, I want to kill myself, I feel faint... so forth. (Not the first time I told him that - in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I'll self harm if I went outside... and he did nothing. Literally nothing. He read it and didn't even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me - I was literally just upstairs. Anyways, the point of that side story is that this is normal).

So back to the main story. I wrote those emails early in the morning, then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep. 

After lunch, my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police. 

OK sure. Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them. 

The police came. What they knew was: Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I'd self harm / suicide and they were worried because I haven't sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive.

They have mixed in some truths with lies. I sent an email, true. The bit where they make a big deal out of it, a lie. (I had no phone calls or emails from them that day - really they could've contacted me if they wanted to. However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it)

The point is, I was fine. I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day, so the doctors didn't think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could've done so against my will. 

There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of  ""care"" or ""worry"" who says they are doing things that they are not. It's hard to tell (most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true), but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn't right. It's just better to trust your instincts. People can let you down or betray your trust.

I'm slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me (someone with a history of mental illness / seen a psychologist). 
Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment, but the police literally can't do anything else - it's the doctors who decide. Doctors at the hospital aren't going to just blindly listen to that ""story"", and going to the hospital doesn't mean that they'll keep you there against your will.

Why did my work place decide to lie? I don't know. They could be genuinely worried, they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance. It really doesn't matter. They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves.

As for my ""friend"". I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing. I honestly do believe if I died he'd shrug it off. I've told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before, but getting personal messages (like whatsapp not just emails) forward off to work? Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm, want to kill myself, wanting them to watch me die, wanting him to regret not helping me. What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault. I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help. He did that more than once actually. At the same time, he's pretending he's a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans. He is like a human version of the workplace. If I can kill myself, I'd make sure he gets haunted by it.

I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more (thinking I could get back at them)"	1

"My kid will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID and the fact that his school is in a different state (it borders our state) than where we live. What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasn’t had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didn’t have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didn’t let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm. He (roommate) said it was due to medical issues but I don’t believe that 100% because if he really needed it to be quiet after 8:00 pm he should have been living by himself.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to make him feel better on his birthday? His school does nothing for birthdays. Every time I talk to him about it he starts to tear up and either leaves the room or changes the subject. For the past two years I sent him balloons and chocolates from this local place near his school. I'm not sure if I can do that this year because of COVID. I think I will be able to but I'm not sure."	2
"I want to talk about suicide without it being a jokeRecently my MDD has kicked in again. Around Easter is always a shit time of year. I'm graduating college soon and I actually have my life mostly planned out, just not implemented yet. I still can't help but feel hopeless and like there's no point. I'm the kind of person that jokes about killing myself or wanting to die. Partially because I mean it and partially because I don't want to be some downer to people around me. My friends who know I've struggled with depression get a little worried about me, but not enough to do much, though I don't know what the hell they could do. 

The last time I openly admitted to wanting to kill myself, my psychiatrist (not counselor) had me admitted to a mental hospital, twice. My closest friend, who I also have a crush on (gay) is the person I want to talk to about this stuff the most, but I feel like he's tired of me. He's the RA of my residence hall and if I'm honest with him about suicide, without just joking, he'd mandated to report it and it's back to the hospital with me. Which I can't do right now because I need to finish my degree and it doesn't help that much anyway. 

Don't know why I decided to post on here. Just did. I'm meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow to talk about switching up meds, but I feel like I can't be honest with her about how I feel."	1

"Suicide watch after a DUI arrest.I was referred to this subreddit, and it is highly applicable.

I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.

Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.

We both attend a university in a ""college town"" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.

Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.

In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

I appreciate your consideration."	1

"You're bored, I'm bored, so why not join a modded Minecraft server?  

My friend wanted me to try and get some more people on his MC server, so here I am. The server has up to 60 slots at one time and is a modded server using the latest version of forge. There quite a few mods, but it doesn't take that long to set up (he has a drive link that has them all in one folder). Would anybody be interested? You can get the mods and server info for the server by joining a discord server. You can try the code posted below, but if that doesn't work - no worries. Joining isn't required, but it's there if you want it.

**RULES**

* The server is a factions/anarchy server, so things are pretty lax as far as rules go
* NO BALE FIRE BOMBS. We have a nuclear warfare mod and for Pete's sake, please don't use the bale fire bomb. You probably won't get banned, but you may get some screams of panic when you see how vastly horrible it is
* Profanity and stuff like that is pretty lax, but no racism or homophobia, transphobia, etc. Basically, don't be a dick. We have an in-game voice chat mod.

"Eventually I will have to commit suicideBasically my story is about Body dysmoprphia and physical health problems
I am a 23 year old guy, 5 years ago if you asked me, I would never see myself talking like this and being a complainer but everyone have their own different situations and problems

I have a unique physical problem with proportions of my body, a problem I didn't have before I was 18. Now I am 23. For 5 years and counting I can't move that freely, my back and hamstrings are always sore from doing normal things. 
The problem is not only physical but it changed the way my body looks so I have developed severe social anxiety. I feel I look too wierd because of how my femur bone(thighs) look.
Before this I was a decent and good looking guy
I don't see myself getting married and even living an average life because my health gets in the way. I couldn't go to college because of this and this doesn't qualify as a disablity but sure feels like it. I work night shift as a security guard, with almost no human interaction. 
So right now I am living with my parents, it's the culture. They also cry when they see their son like this. Only reason I am still alive is because of them.

I seriously want to live this life and get better but I don't find any solution for my problem. Eventually loneliness and repeated cycle of pain will lead me to suicide."	1

"Typing something out before I sleepMan, the day was stressful. I really find myself scared of what I do feeling that. I can take a shower and feel flabbergasted that such actions could've existed.

I don't know what happens when people get older. They join causes. They become activists. They become conspiracy theorists. It happens to ALL OF THEM! They all think they're living works of fiction. Listen to them TALK! It's not that fiction imitates reality. It's that people imitate fiction. Maybe, though, you'll ask them ""what's realistic about movies"" and they'll say ""NOTHING!"" Okay, so why are they all afraid that ""reality is movies?""

How is Rugrats ""worse for kids"" than an R-rated movie or a porno? Hell if I know. The topless beach I was once taken to remains my worst enemy. Just a few hours there twenty years ago and what are people MOST hyperbolic about? Sex. Can't they talk normally? Each time I'm asked about ""topless beaches,"" I know what to expect. They sure have it wrong when I don't want to deal with their obsessions over ""lady nipples not being acceptable in this nation.""

When people get older, at least here, they start to complain about this nation. They cry about ""the better cultures."" I sure HAVE been told ""I've been sympathetic toward the enemy"" for saying that ""I don't care."" 

They have existential crises about whatever corporations get to be trendy. Apparently, they lose their childhood happiness.

I wasn't the kind of kid who was going to discover PBS on my own. Turned out that when kids got older and ""PBS was for babies,"" I couldn't recite jack shit from those shows. Being a toddler, I had hated people associating me with those shows.

People my age are fixated on nostalgia. I don't feel any nostalgia. When people got older and they had gained political views, I couldn't take part in that. Of course, I couldn't. When I had been a child, some things were far better than cartoons had been. It didn't mean they were good, but that didn't stop people from referring to me as a boy genius.

On top of all this, I have family that doesn't treat me well.

Each day, I put on the act and I'm sure visibly distressed. I don't want to deal with each day. Everything is nothing. Nothing is anything. That's not philosophy.

This gives me an inability to truly feel hatred or to understand everyone having ""morality"" fits. I'm always observing this humanity zoo. I'm never wanting to live."	1

I was beaten, yelled at, locked in my room, had my thoughts and opinions constantly invalidated, my babysitter(an ex of my moms) molested me, my brother did on a few occasions as well, I've suffered from depression and self hate my whole life, I've hurt myself a lot through various means and tried to kill myself on multiple occasions to no avail. I can't have a relationship to save my life because my examples of love and compassion were so fucked up. I try and try to fix what damage has been done to me. I've tried everything I can imagine, meds, therapy, meditation, drugs, ignoring it, pretending everything will work out, and I still feel lost and isolated. I don't want to die I just want to be OK and feel something other than pain and hate. I love someone and I can't tell them because if they know what I deal with it will just bring them down. I've spent so long being lost, and isolated, trying to fix myself and the damage that's been done to me, I'm so tired I just want to sleep, to close my eyes and dream forever.
 
I'm sitting on the edge of my bed. In front of me is my mirror and miscellaneous Items that I keep there, keys, wallet, change jar, random knickknacks, stereo, and this time the other 7 rounds from my gun. After all, all I need is this one in the chamber."	1
"Do y’all remember that old dude? I haven’t seen him in a while. Do y’all know his name? He would comment on posts saying

"I may be suicidal but I'm not depressedI've not been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and I'm also not actively trying to kill myself. I just think that life isn't as precious as other people make it out to be, and that sometimes death sounds really appealing. I'm agnostic so I don't believe in any specific afterlife but honestly, most things sound better than living with emotions and expectations that I'll never be able to fulfil.

I'm not trying to kill myself bc I have no reason to right now, but I also don't have a reason to live either, you feel?"	1
"Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub-reddit to post it to. I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow. Apologies for the long post.

I had started working at a company where I [30M] met K [30M]. We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay. Now, he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay. In fact, he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret. This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life. A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person. Furthermore,hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows. 

He has his personal issues why he doesn't want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades. However, I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting.

Honestly, when he first told me about his secret, I tried my best to be laid back about it. I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend. Admittedly, I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting 'love you' or 'xx'. I guess, from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends. However, I (naively) saw nothing wrong in that. 

Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him. Because of this, we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO. He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with. Whilst I enjoy his company, many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely. This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding.

He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often. He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life. I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem. On one hand I wish to keep him in my life, but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this. 

One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience. I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend.

I honestly do not know what to do. Did I do something wrong?

Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

"I am so fucking pissed off it makes me want to finally kill myself.No body cares about me. I have no friends that give a fuck about me, nobody wants to put in any effort to spend time with me or make me feel special--and of course living this way my entire life comes crashing down on me and pisses me the fuck off sometimes. But I can't say shit about it because all that would do is drive people away, so I'm forced to just keep everything inside and hide it the best I can and pretend that I'm somewhat emotionally stable and friendly. 

It makes me want to kill myself, I've already been suicidal for so long because I'm such a fucking loser in life, at least now I realize the rest of the world sucks and hates me and sees me as disposable as much as I do."	1

"People tell me I look disabledWhen I used to go on Facebook, I made my account public and someone commented that I was retarded and a spaz constantly.  I thought my disability was invisible.  

I just want to be one of those beautiful autistic people who doesn't look disabled in pictures, I want to be told ""but there's nothing wrong with you"" when I tell them I'm autistic, but instead I have people pointing out that I do look disabled before I mention that I am.  Having a visible disability is embarrassing and I never want to leave the house again.  Especially since most high functioning autistic girls look LESS disabled than neurotypical girls and I am on the low functioning end disappointed how I could have ended up modelling if my autism was mild.

I have never been told that I don't look disabled.  My disability is VISIBLE.  I literally have a different face and body shape.  On top of that, my grammar is so poor and my IQ is so low that even if I had the body shape of a mildly autistic woman, I would still get called retard if they talked to me.

I don't have the empathy to understand why people are upset about people telling them they don't look disabled.  It's a COMPLIMENT to me.  It's telling me that I am normal looking and I am not retarded.  Honestly why do people want to be told they look disabled?  I'd rather just be told that I am too beautiful and intelligent to be disabled and not get any help whatsoever than be called retarded.

Sorry for the disgusting, narcissistic rant, I am unable to feel empathy and I would rather be dead than people recognising I am disabled just by looking at me.

Sorry for the terrible English, I have low functioning autism."	1

I don’t even know what happened. My wife found out I followed some cosplay (let’s be honest, lewd) models on Instagram and freaked out on me. She blew up. Threw everything within arms reach at me, including a terra-cotta pot filled with a cactus and a sharpening steel. The steel missed me and went through the tempered glass door. This was all in front of my kids. She left and I have no idea where she went. I feel like a fucking failure. She’s right. I am a piece of shit. Honestly the only reason I still had a family was because of my paycheck. If my boys weren’t sleeping in their room right now, I’d just call it quits and end it. I need fucking help. 	1

21 year old NEET with several issues.I am a 21 year old male. I struggle with depression, social anxiety, low self-esteem, daily suicidal thoughts. I am financially dependent on my parents. I don't have a job or go to school. I don't have many friends. Never had a girlfriend. My family doesn't love me. I hate feeling worthless and unwanted. I hate feeling like a disgrace. I know what my dad says about me. I fucked up my driving test because I got too nervous. I fucked up my job interviews. Now I'm too scared to even apply anymore. I should've asked for help before my issues got this worse. I struggle even talking to my parents because I know they'll pass it off. They always have whenever I had a problem. Everything I do I fuck up. I hate feeling rejected. I hate waking up everyday feeling like I'm nothing. I always wished I had never been born when I was a kid. Now, I just want to end it.	1

I'm going to kill myselfI've simply had enough. I'm done, I don't want to live anymore, the effort doesn't seem worth it to continue living. Ive already tried twice with no success a few years ago it got better for about 3 months after 6 years of depression and then it just got worse again. I'm just done. My 3 best friends are the only thing keeping me here but it takes too much effort getting out of bed and living life and after all these years trying to change things up changing some routines nothing worked, therapy didn't help, Nothing has and I kept hearing the same shit I knew didn't do anything, working out didn't help going for walks all that shit everyone who is depressed or suicidal hears from everyone, I've just about seen enough of this world and I hate it here.	1

n gkrd;mdgjgmdm;After a year of playing musical therapists and my medication making my depression worse there is no motivation for me to get better, I am just waiting for the day I am no onger scared of death. I am too far gone to be happy or lead a fufilling life, the ony future I see for myself is as a kermit or as a corpse. I have too many problems to count; severe depression, crippling anxiety a complete lack of social skills, no human interaction outside of my family, weight problems, no motivation to take care of myself, a terribly overactive sex drive, no way to verbally comunicate my problems, and confusion about my gender. I was never meant to live this long, nobody was able to help. All three of my therapists cared very little about my actual progress, I know how hard it is to care about every single patient, and it's not like I was of much use not being able to talk about anything. I don't want help anymore, or rather I don't expect help anymore. I assume that some people are beyond saving.	1

I might just give up. Hey it’s really hard to live. I didn’t think this could happen but all it took was a predator to break my world. I’ve talked to tons of people and some of them were wise and helpful. But right now, I think it doesn’t matter if it’s really great in the future, right now it is really really hard. I don’t think it could be worth it. The things that usually inspire me to keep going aren’t working anymore. It’s strange but everyone that is usually smart and makes me feel better seems ignorant and just unhelpful. Throughout my life I’ve always been told that you have to try and hope. But I just don’t care to anymore. I don’t care if I let the predators win by dying. I don’t care if people think it was dumb of me to give up. I’m not strong enough. I’ll try to talk to my friends in person but if that doesn’t help uh well I don’t what I’ll do but I’m really thinking about killing myself so yeah.	2

"I want to see a point of living , but I cantI'm struggling to find a point to live, but I really can't find one so I bought a gram of heroin to od on.

Here's my story. When I was 7 years old my cousins said they would watch me, but instead of doing that I was gang raped by 5 males and then a few months later I was molested by my sister. On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people. The first time I opened up to someone was my first girlfriend and I had only known her for two weeks. I remember bawling in her arms while she gently stroked my hair. That was the most comforting moment of my life. Well, after awhile of that she got tired of it broke up with me and called me too much of a headache to be around.

Since the day she broke up with me alll I've had ar my two best friends in the world. And then disowned me as a friend recently because they are very religious and all they could do to cheer me up is tell me to be live in God and I would usually just nod my head ok. I recently told them that I would appreciate it if they wouldn't bring up God anymore and they said if you can't accept him then we have nothing else to say to you. They won't return my calls or text anymore. Now I have no one. I've been laying in bed everyday untill I have to go to work then when I get off I just sleep untill work again. I'm not close with my family at all and they were the only friends that I had. "	1
"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.

So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow. 
I really don't think I can't make it another day."	1

I have a very unique outlook on collegeI don't want to be here anymore. Period. I am done with any education at this point. I have been in school for the past 15 years and I am just done with it. I am currently enrolled in college and I don't give a crap anymore. I already skipped classes on my first day, that's how much I care about getting a degree at this point. I want to drop out but I don't have anything else in life. I have no friends outside of my job that pays me shit, I don't have any talents or skills, I have no real world experience as I've been living in my parents basement for the past 3 or so years. If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't. I really loathe going to college where I end up just browsing the internet on my laptop until it's time to go home. I am such an asshole jerk, you don't need to tell me. I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off. Help.	1
Dude if my debit card doesnt get here tomorrow....I will be fucking pissed....I just wanna buy some fucking fentanyl shit	1

"I can't I can't I can't I can't take it anymore.

I can't take it anymore.

I can't take it anymore.

I. can't. Take. It. Anymore.

I! Can't! Take! It! Anymore!

I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE !!!!!!!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do, what to say.

There is nothing more to do, nothing more to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want my body to turn off, to join my spirit. It would be better if they disappeared together. 

Why did you leave me? I'm alone. You were my last hope of redemption. You were the last person I would smile at. I needed a friend.

Why did you leave me?

Why did you leave me?

Why am I so alone? Where are all the people who used to be in my life? Where are all the people I loved? Where are all the people without whom I could not live? Where are the too many guests at my birthday party? 

I have too many fingers to count those who remain. I don't think there are any left.

The student loneliness that we talk about so much only starts when the classes stop.

WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS!!! 

How did I get here?

I have no hope left. I have no future. I don't have any feelings anymore. I am no longer happy, sad, in love, angry, passionate, anxious, overexcited. Everything is gone.

I need to get better. I need to get better. I need to get better. I'm really going to die. My body can't take the pain in my head any longer. I'm really going to die. There's nothing else left. It's only a matter of days, my heart will stop beating on its own. I don't know when I last lived. I don't know when I last felt happiness. I don't know when I last felt an emotion. I would like to be drunk to forget everything. I would like to drown myself in alcohol so I don't remember that I don't feel anything.

No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 

Why am I alone?

I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.

But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry. I would like to cry. Sometimes I read something or hear music, and I want to cry, but I can't. If there is a god somewhere, I beg him to stop my agony. Whatever the way. Please. Please."	2

"Suicidal 11 yr oldI'm 31 and my best friend of over 25 years has an 11 yr old who recently tried to kill himself and was later admitted into suicide watch after detailing a plan for a second attempt. My best friend is an incredible person and wants to help but isn't well read or a great communicator. My friend has asked me for help because he knows he's not great at these things and I want to do everything I can to help because they've both already persevered through so much and he's family as far as I'm concerned.

What are the best things I can do to support them? 

What are the best resources for parents with suicidal kids?

How can he best support his son?

Your advice means more to me than you know. Thank you."	1
"Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex-boyfriend.I don't really know what to say here, I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest. For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.
Also, in case someone was wondering why I don't go to another friend for help instead of my ex, it's because my ex is literally the only friend I have. I had a clique that we both hung out with but I(stupidly) pushed them away."	1
"I'm so sadI'm just so fucking sad and lonely. I had an okay day today but it crashed so hard. I've literally 0 friends not even online ones cos no one's likes me. I've a boyfriend but he feels like a mistake but I just can't loose him. 
I'm so lonely and sad I just don't know what to do anymore tbh. I'm really fucking struggling, I don't go to school and I don't rly do anything, I never leave my house. I'm so fucking ugly someone help me"	1
"I don't know how to get my hands on a gun.I don't want to mess up suicide, but I have no way to access a gun or buy one. 

I don't want an overdose. I don't want to jump in front of a train. I can't jump off of a building. 

I don't want to traumatize random strangers or cause collateral damage of any kind. 

I want my death to be comfortable and on my own terms. I need a gun, and I need a nice quiet place in the middle of the woods. 

I want to walk until I can't anymore, I want to watch the sunset with a glass of rum and I want it to be a quick death."	1

"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for pitchforks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.

K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.

""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.

He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.

""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""

The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.

""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.

One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.

""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.

After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.

""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.

""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.

""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.

""I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,"" The voice said, ""and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!"" She continued.

""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""

""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.

""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.

They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.

""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.

""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.

""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.

""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.

He unplugged himself from the computer.

""Well now I have job to do."" He said to himself."	2
"I feel like im wasting time.
First off im sorry how scrambled this is. I cant think straight. 

Im a 22 year old male, i have been depressed for quite awhile now. It comes and goes and i dont know where it came from. I lost my brother in a car accident when i was 18 and he was 19 just a month shy of 20. I feel like that is probably the main factor but it doesnt seem like it on the surface. 

I have many issues and i dont know what to do tho. I have no career paths, i have no money saved.... I love music and i am pretty good at it and a lot of people in my city are into what i do, but i just cant write music like i used to. I will work for 15 hrs a day and get nothing, Not only that but i just feel i have no time anymore. I work full time and i also play video games a lot which i love, i never go outside, i never see friends. I see my girlfriend and thats it, and really all we do is watch tv and stay in bed. I want to say its her fault because she doesnt have any hobbies, she relys on me super heavily and if im not with her shes mad. As fucked up as it sounds i still adore her. Shes gained weight and that effects her mental state and 7 years she still wont show me her nude body. Theres just so much and i dont know what to do. Where to go with my life and i feel its eating my insides to where im done.... im good at a lot but im not good enough. The one girl i love treats me poorly and wont even get comfortable with me enough to show me herself. I hate my family even tho they have done so much for me and treat me well, i just think they are robotic and i cant stand being with them. 

I cant even fucking write properly, i see this post is allover the place but i just need to vent. I dont wanna kill myself because i know what death does to people. I may relieve myself but in doing that i hurt my friends and family and my girlfriend. 

I just dont know where to go from here. I want music to work out but i would lose my girlfriend. I want my girlfriend to work out but ill lose my music. I cant do both cause i feel u dont have enough time in a day. Im lost. Im sad. Im happy when i take drugs. Im happy when i drink. Im not a druggie or an alcoholic.  I just i feel nothing anymore. Everything i loved i hate now. Its a fucking chore. I dont know what the fuck to do."	1
I will not live any longer.No long, boring suicide note here. I'm killing myself as soon as I post this. No point in continuing to suffer. Thank you and good bye. 	1
So, i did it. I finally confessed to my crush I know that there are lots of likewise posts in here, and mine is no different. When I asked her if she had someone on her mind, she said that “we haven’t even finished school yet”. Her response to a question if she did like someone but felt she was not ready for a relationship was: “it is personal, not public”. I understand that, and respect her choice but can do nothing but be heartbroken. I had feelings for her for the last FIVE years, but was too afraid to tell her. Recently, my friends convinced me to confess, and I did. I have no regret, but am just really sad for I really thought that my feelings were mutual.	2
I’m trying to find an old friend If anyone plays over watch, and by some miracle you know him I’ll be forever grateful, I believe his username is castaway2006, or, his name is Ralph. If you think you know him, please dm me, thank you!	2
"I feel like I am slippingnot sure what to even say...

I am just in a bad place. I have friends that I usually go to, but they have both been venting to me tonight so I have felt like I shouldn't go to them tonight. Also I hurt one of them (unintentionally) recently and the guilt is making things so much worse.

I have struggles with anxiety and depression for years, I am on meds, I don't like therapy but I really should start going again.

I can't really say what is causing today to be so bad other than the guilt and the feeling I always seem to have.

Tonight is the first time in my life I have gone to self harm, I cut myself tonight, 3 small cuts on my arm. I am afraid of this happening all the time and of it escalating. I heard someone say today that they can't wait for this week to be over....And all I could think was ""I can't wait for my life to be over"""	1
I don’t ask much out of life All I want is a thicc chick who can suffocate me with her thighs if I piss her off	2
"I have a small dick, I think I'm ugly, and I don't know what to doI don't believe people when they say ""size doesn't matter"" girls want thick dicks with a decent length. And don't give tell me how there's exceptions. What matters is what the majority of people think, not the exceptions. 

It's 5 inches long and 4.5 inches is girth. I have pics under my post history. Both are below average. My dick is so fucking skinny and I hate it. Girls want that filled up feeling. I will never provide that. 

I'm also ugly as shit. I've had girls like me and my tinder matches are cute but I don't think I look good. 

Basically, I'm an ugly guy with a small dick that will never satisfy a girl. I don't know if I actually will commit suicide but I don't want to keep on living if my dick will never make a girl happy. 

I'm smart, I plan on being a dentist, but I'm ugly and I have a small dick so no girl will ever want me for me. "	1
I did something new today I ain't telling you. Nosey ass basards.	2
"Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk.  I talked about football with this random guy.  I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears.  I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed. I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache.  I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life.  I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have, so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide.  I sat at the bar, almost falling off the stool, and it really hit me this time.  I really could kill myself tonight.  I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge, what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying.  Was it peaceful, was it scary, was it just somewhere in between? What it is, is the feeling, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, you would not feel the consequences of suicide, because you will be dead.  All of my friends? My family? If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them, but in reality I won't exist, it won't effect me, it will be....nothing.  I silently decided, ""ok, I think tonight is the night"".

I stood up, turned to the guy I was talking to, smiled and told him to have a great night. He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ""ok you too"", and I left.  My first thought was ""are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to""? And immediately, I thought yes. Who cares. It's all symbolic horse shit that won't mean anything after I'm dead.  It's the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach, and that's never been me, so why should I care.  I left the bar, and just started......walking.  I didn't know where I was going, but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination. I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit. I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars, all with a major, a plan, a path.  I've never really envied them, or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier, but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet, for better or for worse. Last night though, I couldn't help but find the humor in it.  Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone, that I went to school somewhere, that I had an identity outside of being nobody.  It made me think about how there's probably plenty of people I see, actively contemplating their death, that just blend in like me. It made me think, even if it were just for a second, to reconsider what I aimed to do that night.

I thought about it for a second. I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning.  Then I remembered, I already made my choice.  I didn't sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now.  I intended to do what I've known needed to be done since I was 16.

I kept walking, and walking, and walking.  I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window.  I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health.  I thought about how now, in retrospect, I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday.  I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun.  I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for.  At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson. It was about 12AM at this point.

I finally reached a highway.  It wasn't like an interstate, more like a 3 lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it.  I'd see these 18 wheelers come buy at 65 MPH. Upon seeing this, I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things.  I thought about it for a second.  What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident? What if it killed other people but not me?  I couldn't bring myself to do it for that reason.

I continued walking down the highway. Even though I wasn't gonna jump in front of one of these cars, everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road.  I walked until I saw a park 

I don't know what possessed me, but I just entered the park with no intention.  I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it. I leaned over the side and vomited, then I passed out.  I woke up 2 hours later with an awful headache.  Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life. I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it, and I let it slip away.  I don't know when I'll ever be able to capture it again.

Today, I woke back up in purgatory where I'll remain. Life is endless suffering."	1
"I'm invisibleGranted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings. I've sought therapy and a psych for meds but it seems like they never want to hear the bad or try to ""silver lining"" my struggles by saying I'm so strong....I'm tired, no exhausted, from being so strong. When am I allowed to be vulnerable and get real help? Not just a Rx bandaid that doesn't work."	1

Sick Of The LonelinessI have been at an all time low these past few months.  I have always dealt with depression and anxiety since I was about 8 or 9.  I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.  Whenever I try and talk to someone that isn't my psych (who I barely get to see because of work) I feel I am being judged by them.  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.  I am sorry this is a jumbled mess but I just needed to say this.	1
Being dead will bring happiness and fulfillment to everyone around me over timeIt’ll prevent me bringing people down and bumming them out. Future heartbreak, arguments, all of it can be prevented if I’m dead. Family gatherings will be more fulfilling, with the runt of the litter of cousins gone. Some deaths can have a positive impact like me. My family will be closer together not having to deal with me. I can leave money for them with my passing	1

"JUST do this, don’t thinkDon’t think too much about this, JUST do it:

- Find a quite place, where you’ll not get disturbed

- You can sit or lay down for this

- Close your eyes

- Imagine a small river that flows. 
On that river there are some leaves. 

- Now put every, and i mean every, thought you have on a leave and let it flow down the river.
Don’t make the river go faster of slower. Just observe as the thought flows on the river.

- If you get distracted by a thought, it’s okay, just come back to the river again, and put that thought on a leave and let it flow.

Do this for at least 3-5 mins.

I don’t see how the future could change as I’ve felt this way since 7th grade, i keep telling myself things will get better but they never do. I hate my life and I don’t see a reason to keep trying"	2
Just wanna know if I’m not alone in this So anyone else think that relationships are over rated. I’ve been lead on, let down and heart broken in the past and I was done with feeling emotion and forming super close bonds with people. I’ve grown out of my shell a bit and I just wanna smash and go. Anyone with me???	2

"Today was my birthday Today I got to play minecraft with 5 friends. Here's how that went

1. I played minecraft for 8.5 hours today. My siblings were annoyed because I wanted be in my room alone because I was on a vc.

2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.

3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.

4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.

5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said ""when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?"" 

6. The same friend called drowns ""pickaxe munchkins"" and ""angry boys"" when he got attacked by them.

7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 

8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).

9. I was the 2nd person to find diamonds but the first to mine them (the first was flower pot guy in a village chest), and I got to make the nether portal. So thats cool. I died in the nether tho.

Today was a good day tho."	2

"Wrote my final note tonightThought I don’t plan on needing to use it for another few years unless I face a crisis and really need to get out of here. To sum it up:

“I failed as a sibling, child, and person. I am so sorry. Since I was little I knew I was stupid and a mistake. I never learned how to talk to others. Always so anxious and felt like I was gonna throw up. The few times I did open up to people it ended badly. I’ve constantly been the family embarrassment. It never even had to be said sometimes. When there was an event my older and younger siblings would go but I’d be left home. If mysterious be “sick” if people asked where I was. People also mentioned how weird I was and thought I was autistic at one point. I’m so sorry I failed. The other two are doing well and are good representations for the family. Please forget my existence happened. If I have any pets alive please give them to a good shelter if you don’t want them. I’m so sorry.”"	1

"It's happening again..It's been 5 to 8 years since I've felt anything like this. I've been suicidal before, even attempted and at the time thankfully failed. I thought I was past it, I thought I'd grown above such bullshit.

But, here I am again, feeling like there's no point to it all and really REALLY not wanting to be here, it's actually stronger than it ever was before.

I don't even know what triggered it, it just came on, it wasn't really triggered by anything. I don't have any food money, the heating has been out for days and fuck knows when the electricity meter might run out, but those things didn't really trigger it.

The only thing that I feel is worth being here for is my partner, of 4 years. But they understand, they'd be upset, but they would actually understand, that it can be better for this shit to stop.

I actually don't know what to do with myself right now, I've wandered up and down the stairs three times this morning aimlessly, just, walking into rooms feeling like I should be doing something but not knowing what, I feel, I don't even know what I feel. I just don't want to be here."	1
wish I was brave enough to cut my wrists againBeen feeling awful all day slept for hours got up went back to bed woke up at 5pm.

Im just gonna get into it. My friend has a history of trama, self harm, even attempted once and i just feel really helpless on what to do. He keeps saying hes tired and hes done with it all, tired of the flashbacks when he wakes up everyday, tried of having breakdowns.Hes tried medication, therapy for a few years, went to the hospital, it truly seems like hes done everything he can in his eyes. Im just so scared of what could happen, the only reason he hasnt done anything is because he wonders what i would do if he did. I really would like any advice here on what to do, i just feel so powerless. Hes a very special person in my life and i just want to do what i can.
Thank you."	1
"Depression has killed my marriage. Now I want to die.I'm 28, husband is 29, and I'm in a sexless marriage. For years I wondered and thought it was me. Maybe I'm ugly, maybe he's just turned off by me, maybe maybe maybe. He would always say he didnt know why he just wouldnt make a move. I was always the one to do it first. 

Today, he finally told me that my depression and anxiety, living with it, has turned him off. He prefaced by saying he knows it wasn't my fault and that he knows I've been trying. He was also hesitant to speak on it out of fear of hurting my feelings. 

Here I am now, feelings hurt. I feel devastated, like a part of me, the hope I had that I could fix this has died. I've been on and off different medications. I've been to therapy. I've been trying. But nothing matters. My work doesnt matter. I dont matter.

So now I'm here alone in my bed. Crying my eyes out to the point of exhaustion. I want to die. The only person keeping me here today is my mother. I know my death would break her heart...

But I just feel so empty. I keep picturing myself slitting my wrist in the tub like a bad movie, or just overdosing on pills. I keep seeing myself running into traffic or driving off the side of the road. Maybe I dont have the guts idk. I just want this to be over. This pain isnt fun. Trying to catch my breath. Beating my head like it's an old television and I'm trying to get good reception, just hoping I can fix it... 

I dont want this. I want help to fix my brain. I hate myself for it. I hate him for not accepting me. I hate the world that lables mental illness. I hate this life. I hate having to live with these secret thoughts day in and day out. I hate that nobody knows me. I hate that I want to die."	1

"My Weird kink 

Credit: u/potheadboyz


So I have a super weird kink. I like my women a bit on the insane side. To be more specific, it turns me on if a girl holds a knife to my neck (in a joking way of course, interpret that how you will) it turns me on especially if we're making out or having sex. Also kinda turns me on if she treats me like property, like I belong to her (now I don't mean she uses me as a wallet). I know this is an unrealistic kink and there is no one in the world like this but it's  something I fantasize about. Probably one of the weirdest kinks ever.

I’ve never heard something so accurate"	2

"I'm nothing and I won't have anything enjoyable in my life.Firstly, I'm sorry for my bad English but I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I'm 18 years old boy and I've been planning to commit suicide for couple of months. I would probably do it already, if not the fact, that I doesn't want to hurt my mother and my friend. 

Maybe you're wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that. Well, I would rather ask: Why shouldn't I? There is no happiness for me, now or in the future. I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what's the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man. I don't know if happiness isn't destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? There's is not a good thing waiting for me, period.

Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing. For me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy. It may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that I have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion. Maybe that's the reason why I want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that I'm not able to do. 

I was thinking about becoming an writer. That's a way, right? People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine. Well, there's the problem, I'm not good enough, to make it work. Although I enjoy writing, what's the fucking point, if it doesn't reach wider public?

Secondly, I know it my sound kind of cheesy, but I don't think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend. And, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible. There are various reasons for that:

\- I'm ugly and overweight

\- I'm shy and introvertic

\- I'm bad at having conversations

\- I'm kind of a weirdo (I don't like generic music and stuff)

\- etc.

It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it's so fucking painful, man. And it's really not about sex, I don't give a fuck about sex, I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone. It's about love and everything that comes with that.

For the end I'm just gonna say, wish me, that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge."	1

"Okay bois, so I need to know if a plan of mine will work So, where do I begin? (From the begining, I know) but, It's kinda a long story, so I will try to make it as short as possible.

So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know ¨I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too young¨ (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.

A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 

And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?"	2

"A Lot of My Friends Are Toxic. Should I Leave Them? Additionally, How Should I Go About Making New Friends? 
Yeah. I’m doing school online so I can’t make friends at school. My friends and I fell off. We do not feel like friends anymore. 

I want to leave them. I want to make new friends. I’ve never had online friends before. Is that what I should do?

I don’t know. I just want friends that I can do stuff with/hang out with/talk to. I haven’t had that in a very long time."	2
"Just looking for some support.I've attempted suicide once, unsuccessfully, and actually for a bit afterwords felt like I made the wrong choice and deserved to stay alive. These days I just feel empty though, and I feel like I'm sleepwalking through my life. It's kind of funny that today is the cake day of this account, I guess it really must be something about this time of year. Fuck spring I guess.

I've been really terribly depressed and I don't feel like I'm going to be able to claw my way out of this for a while. I don't know if I'm going to even graduate anymore as my second semester grades have reached a rock bottom. I used to be an A and B, very occasional C student, but currently I have two F's, one D, and C's across the board elsewhere. Even if I do pull things up I don't think that the college I was admitted to will still allow me to enroll, as I'm fairly certain this big of a plummet in grades will result in a rescinding of my admission. I had my senior recital last Tuesday, a show I spent months practicing for, but got so anxious once I got on stage that I had to stop halfway through my set because I was butchering every song and walked off stage in tears. I've started having behavioral problems because I just feel angry and want to act on it which led to me getting my first behavioral referral due to me calling out a teacher on Facebook and being reported for it, my friends use me for my car and my money and stop hanging out with me when I cut them off but I'm so desperate for interaction that I keep them around. My parents are disappointed and worried, I can't find success in any of things I want to be good at and I'm really not sure what I'm doing anymore. I think I'm going to kill myself soon, I just don't know how. I really wish my life wasn't a perpetual cycle of shitty days."	1

A sufficient reason not to kill yourselfWith the lockdown, you can’t fantasise about your crush and the 1,5 friends you have left to be at the funeral.

"TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously, even your doctors and therapists.Everybody thinks you're just being immature or finding excuses for your failures. The only time they realise that you're really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it's all too late.

You might think the ""professionals"" would act totally different. But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible, and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn't help and wouldn't care as long as it's my life not his child's.

I'm trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days. Don't want to live through a life I'm incapable of living through while nobody cares at all."	1

"I'm here for something different.I constantly think about killing myself, ending it all. I have gotten to the point of wanting to do it and even formulating a plan, but never taken steps to do it. I don't currently want to die, I want to leave. I would like advice on how to leave.  
- I live in the Midwest (US) 
- Under 18  
- Access to physical goods totaling over 10k~ (3k Cash, ext)  
- No licence (car)   
- Parents split, much freedom  
- Passport  
- Gay male
I guess this might be the wrong sub, someone can tell me if it is. I just... I don't necessarily want to die, I just want the situation to change. Maybe I'm depressed I don't know. I just want to leave, get it all over with. Maybe i'm just a spoiled brat, idk. Thanks  
Edit: By leave I mean get as far away from the midwest as possible.

I just keep ending up in the same placeEvery time I start feeling good or being happy I end up in the same dark place.  I get to thinking about my life and what I have in the future and none of it is good.  I feel like I've already failed and fucked everything up, with school and my family.  And with my best friend I feel like I irritate him so much.  Like I constantly am feeling down and depressed and I can tell he knows, and I feel so fucking guilty.  And it just keeps spiraling more and more to where I want to kill myself.  I end up hurting myself physically and then I feel even worse and it happens over and over.  I want it all to stop.  I really wish there were a way for me to just stop living with no pain or chance to second guess myself.  I want it over right now.	1

"I can’t live with myself anymoreI’m a truly awful human being, I just can’t stand to be me anymore. 

I’ve had depression for so fucking long. No matter what I do, no matter what meds I take, no matter what therapist I see, it doesn’t go away. It makes my life unbearable. It has become so exhausting to even breathe. 

I’m unbearable in of itself. My appearance is disgusting, my personality annoys everyone. I’m bi in a town full of homophobic people. I’m dumb and can’t do anything right.

I don’t know if anything exists after death but if something does, I hope the next life is better than this one."	1

"I'm only 14F and very depressed. I'm not sure what I should do.I have really major depression and I've been feeling suicidal and empty since the first grade. I've always got bullied because of my appearance and because I'm stupid, etc. It got bad to a point where I just wanted to take online school, and so I did. It was going fine until I got too depressed to even do anything. I'm most likely going to get held back.(I actually got held back before in first grade because I have a learning disability. :/)

I see no hope at all for my future. I'm stupid, very stressed, anxious, I have no irl friends, I lack social skills, I can't do things for myself, and I'm addicted to the internet. My family is emotionally abusive and because of them and bullying is most likely why I have depression in the first place.

"Secrets shall be revealed here today people ask how I got so much karma with such a low age account so heres the secret

Go to r/pics or r/PoliticalHumor and post a picture of a minority (Eg Homeless, black, mexican) making a statement against trump, this statement can be on twitter ([I used this one](https://i.redd.it/46m6mwqavft41.png)) You cannot use twitter on r/pics so for this sub you use protest signs or as I used a homeless sign, before you do this ensure they cant check your profile and see you are active on a sub like r/PoliticalCompassMemes but if some one notices and comments then just ignore it and dont even defend your self (I made this mistake and am now perma banned from pics)

If you have done all this right then you should have a post in hot with some awards, if this doesn't work the first time repeat until it does because eventually it will. 

You can also use r/politics and find a headline about something dumb republicans did but this sub has an account age time

You may also use r/blackpeopletwitter and find a black guy making fun of trump, this one will also usually work

And once you have gotten all that karma and awards you delete that shit so it doesn't stain your account and you can easily do it again, have fun!"	2
I’ve started to get happy at the thoughts of my suicide.Like I’ve had suicidal thoughts for ages now and they used to make me feel like shit. Then I just had a sudden realisation that maybe I should be dead and the whole reason I am feeling like this all of the time is that I am meant to be dead. After that I started to feel happy about the suicidal thoughts. Like I’ve imagined my whole suicide, like my parents finding my body hanging in my room, all of my friends finding out, my mum fucking crying at my funeral, the whole thing,  and it made me fucking happy, it’s the only thing that really makes me feel happy now.  Which just shows how fucking selfish I am really.	1

No reason to live if you aren’t normalThis will be my last post I don’t plan on using reddit because tomorrow I’m actually going to be going through with my plan to just kill myself and get it over with. I already have my stuff planned out no talking me out of this one I have my letters written and am going to send out my last text to loved ones which is just family in an hour or two and finish the day playing Pokémon and from there wake up and drive out look for a cliff and just jump off. I hate the fact that I don’t look normal I’m smaller than the average guy and always envied tall and average height guys because they have the luxury of being normal. All I’m ever seen as is just some loser who overcompensates for his height. I never even liked my life that much either college sucks and was a complete lie people told me when they said college gets better. “It gets better” what a bunch of bullshit. I’m thinking of taking out someone else but murder will just land me in jail not death well at least not immediately but I do plan on doing something stupid since it won’t matter so hopefully I’ll do something fun/illegal but in the end just leads to my death anyway.	1
Need some ideas about this book I'm writing I have to write a book about self-discovery and I'm planning to write about a father who raises his daughter in isolation with no government system, but I don't know how to add different problems that relate could relate to self-discovery and identity, can someone help me with some ideas?	2

"How long will this lastSince i was 8 years old i have had some thoughts about kiling myself, but from 12 to 15 i thought about it daily. Then suddenly it stopped at 15, i didnt think about killing myself at all. And i thought that this was just some stupid ""teenager depression"" thing. For a year i thought, about how everything is going good. But now, suddenly i am starting to get more and more days filled with thoughts about killing myself, Then days where i think i am stupid for thinking that and that i am such a great human, and that i am better than most people on earth, and then again days where i hate myself even more. I have a pretty good life,  i have friends, i dont look terrible, yet i want to kill myself even more now. What the fuck is wrong with me"	1
"Not enough energy for emotions? Can someone relate?my first post here, i'm not exactly sure why i'm typing this out but heck it, maybe some of you can relate

a few months ago I used to scream and cry and cut myself. I had episodes where I really felt like i was one push away from just ending it all and that made me panic so much i would spend nearly hours screaming and hyperventilating in my bed. 

I don't why but strangely enough i miss it a lot, everything's so dull now. I just spend all day moping around and feeling nothing except tired. Often i want to cry and can feeling clogging up in my throat, but nothing comes out, like i don't even have the energy to cry half the time. I kinda wish I could scream and throw a fit and feel something like I used to

Is this a sign things are getting better or worse? I don't even know what i want anymore. I still think about suicide but it's more feeling it's vaguely coming and less thinking i'm right about to do it"	1

"Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. 

However i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. 

Of course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.

The grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.

When class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **""It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!""** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.

I talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?

If you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.

TLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.

 Thanks for reading this rant I just had to vent a little."	2

"First day of high school! Hooray, right? I'm in high school. I'm gonna get a better education. I'm gonna have so much fun. Pretty much all my old friends from middle school are in the same high school as me and most of them are in the same class as me. Hooray, right?

If only I wasn't such a fucking failure of a human being, huh. If only I knew how to keep a conversation going. If only I knew how to talk to new people. If only I could get enough sleep to actually listen in school. If only I didn't basically have panic attacks in the middle of the hallway because there are too many people around. If only I wasn't constantly anxious about having all the possible mental and physical illnesses in the book. If only I wasn't bi and trans. If only I had a relationship with my dad whom I live with. If only the one person who I feel like actually gives a shit about me in this world didn't live 700km away.

I fucking know that no-one cares and that everyone has their problems. I just want someone to listen to me. I'm just so done and so miserable. I have no friends. I have zero social skills. I'm constantly anxious. Why does life have to be like this?"	2

"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance"" — William Shakespeare

Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.

The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.

Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.

I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:

* Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
* The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
* They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.

The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.

Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

I hereby assert that eating is just as important as maths or history and therefore a sufficient amount of time has to be allocated to it."	2
Suicidal, but my life is fine.My life is actually kinda going pretty great now. But, for some reason, I still feel the desire to end my own life. You’d expect it to be scary or whatever, but it’s not. I’m doing a lot of stuff that I’ve wanted to for a while as of late and my birthday is coming up. But, for whatever reason, my brain is telling me that I want to die. It’s weird and hard to explain. Sorry for bad explanation.	1

"I guess this is it.I always knew that I’d end up in the obituary section of a small town newspaper. My grieving parents would find a picture of me (maybe one from high school) and it would be pasted in grayscale between ‘Doris Smith, 88, survived by seven grandchildren’ and ‘Emory Deacon, 56, who succumbed after a long illness’.  People would see that I was only 24 and wonder what happened. *Was it a car accident? The poor dear probably had something terminal. It’s a shame to see someone die so young.*

Is it? I’m 24 years old and I don’t remember what it’s like to be normal. This dusty room and my elderly parents are all that I have left in the world. The anxiety is constant and the panic attacks even happen when I’m sleeping. The doctor’s office smelled like Lysol and the nurse didn’t mind when I cried. The white pills make me drowsy and the small green ones make me sweat. I can’t stop grinding my teeth but they say I’m getting better now.

I accept that I’m dying and offer this as my final testament: Paradise is understanding. Words are better wasted than unspoken.  I would have named my daughter Adeline. I can’t stop grinding my teeth and I would have named my daughter Adeline.

I always hear that "" until you love yourself no one will ever love you!!""

I missed out on all of the things that make you feel like a person
. I can't see that there is any reason to not kill myself at some point in the future and when I have enough or if something happens to me and I can't work anymore that's what I'm going to do.

15 and ready to go.I’m so tired of this all. Every single day, I am laughed at in the streets, put down by my peers and I just feel invisible. I feel meaningless. Just today I overheard some girls talking about how I look “anorexic” (I’m a really skinny guy). I’ve tried to fix myself I’ve literally begged my parents to let me lift weights and gain confidence but they believe that it will damage my “bones” and “growth”. Even my brother (who is a fitness geek) has told them not to let me lift or do anything of the sort. I’m stuck and there’s only one way out. I’m tired of being the short (only 5 foot 7) , skinny, invisible, ugly guy but I just know there’s really no way out. This is really my last try. If anyone has anything, any genuine advice to give me then please just let me know. And just for reference, I resorted to plastic surgery after years of teasing a few years back. The only thing that’s changed is they just focus on every other flaw now.	1

Everyone i know is getting ill either because they got the vius or our immune systems are weak due to lockdown. I would give a month at most until another total lockdown. If you look at the cases it speaks for itself, the cases rise in the weekdays and flats out on weekend. Masks physically cannot do anything to help either, people are so densely packed its pointless.

"FUCKHey y'all

Another year and another handful of attempts later, here I am. Against all rhyme and reason I stand. I've heard so much motivational drivel that at this point it just goes in and out of my ears like trying to catch water with a dishrag. For years, the same ""it'll get better!"" ""you are more than this"" ""it's just a feeling"" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty. 

I don't want to see the new year, there's no hope left. No light at the end of the tunnel. Not for me anyways, whatever's to come will be better when I'm gone.

Unsure if this is a final goodbye or some twisted cry for help or just the rantings of some sick, sad person. I'll keep you posted.

Happy new year. If you see any hope at all, you better cling to that and don't let go until you've got enough hope and happiness to last you lifetimes.

Always check if you are mute So today I was having Zoom meeting in art. I showed one of the drawing I made and unmuted my self to tell how I made it. Once I stopped sharing my screen I forgot to mute. Sometimes I whisper when I read/write so the class was hearing whispering and we were also in the discussion of ASMR. My teacher found out it was me and I immediately muted myself and said I had to go since either way I had to eat. This taught me a lesson to always check if you are mute or not.	2

I won't make it to 21People would kill to get the advantages I have had in my life, from a fairly wealthy and supportive family to being born in one of the most prosperous areas in the world.  However, I can hardly get myself to attend my college classes, and it is my first year.  I would have blown my brains out already if it wasn't for my parents supporting me, it would destroy them to have their son die.  I just know I won't amount to anything in my life, I think I am just too lazy or maybe something is wrong in my head.  I have tried to get better but it didn't work in high school and it isn't working now.  The only place I see myself in 2-3 years is either as a bum leeching off of my parents or dead, and I am not sure what to do.  I'm not sure what I expect from this post, but I guess it just helps to see my thoughts typed out and if anyone else feels the same way.	1

"My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course, I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag. When am I allowed to give up?My sister (20) has been suicidal/depressed since she was about 13 years old and she has only gotten worse. It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her. Since then she hasn’t ever really recovered - did receive some help around then. She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesn’t work and she decides to kill herself “she’s tried her best”. 

Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help (she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help), I have been the only one she can turn to. 

She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend. I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all I’m doing is trying to help. Her reactions aren’t that of a normal person so it’s really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I don’t make her angry while doing so. 

At this point, it really is affecting my mental health (have been working through my own depression) and I have no idea what to do. I can’t imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also can’t be her punching bag forever. She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too. Do I just let her? "	1
"I'm patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic, but as someone who has considered suicide since they were 8 years old, I jump to ""dramatic"" conclusions quickly. I've been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and I've realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else. I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I'm from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity. Now I go to an art school because, believe me, I'm not capable of doing anything else. I am fucking stupid. And yes, it's expensive to be here. And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it's still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn't come with that much money. I've been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it's only on essentials. 
Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn't afford all of this. My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time. I spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I'm going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time. I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn't. I left empty handed and feeling like shit. 
On top of school materials, I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few. I've resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it. 
I've heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn't completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments. Don't really want to think about it right now but I'll do it anyways. My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I'm on my own.
I'm not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from 16 stories down onto the sidewalk and die. I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic. Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can't afford.

"End of week twoToday marks the end of the second week in quarantine. I’ve been working from home, and I almost never leave my tiny living space. I’m here 24/7, completely alone. 

I don’t think anyone would care if I died. I know my mom would, but everyone else would forget after a week. I have no purpose. I have no *reason* to wake up tomorrow. There’s nothing happening tomorrow that I need to be here for. Same for the day after that, and the day after that. I just wake up and work for eight hours. Then I sit there not knowing what to do with myself. 

I used to be able to think about killing myself, and it brought me a lot of comfort. But now I’m new meds and they’re working. I can’t think about death anymore. Which I know is supposed to be good, but I feel like I lost my only real coping mechanism. I always felt that no matter how bad things got, no matter how much pain I was in, I could always kill myself. And I sort of feel like I lost that comforting thought. 

I just don’t see any reason to be here. I don’t want to be here."	1
"I need guidance... please help me.Nothing religious, oh God no. (haha, funny joke.) but i feel like I'm dying on the inside. I'm so alone.. Forever Alone even rejected to be with me. I'm in high school now, and I've had these thoughts since forever, around 7th grade. I'm the epitome of a failure, i have nothing going for me. 

I spend my entire afternoon studying, and yes, my ENTIRE afternoon. Sometimes it goes to 5 hours of just one subject because I'm too stupid to understand the simplicity, or logicality of it. I'm in two AP classes, my GPA is a 3.468. I do have friends, yes. Maybe I'm not entirely forever alone, but i have never had a girlfriend. I'm too shy, i don't know how being a kid works. My parents don't talk to me, i'm given full independence of thinking, but i'm not allowed outside of my home. My parents want me to be independent, but they still won't let me outside. I spend my whole night studying, and thinking of what could have been, or what could be. I don't see myself in the future, mostly because i feel like ending it now. I don't know why, i feel so fortunate, but i feel so insignificant, i feel like a nuisance. I feel like i'm the one my friends hate together, or make fun of me behind my back, even though i KNOW they don't. I just feel useless, empty, and pathetic. Everyday. I study and study, and still can't get good grades, while other kids in my class don't study at all, and pass the class with a straight 100 in every test. I do all my homework, even if it's optional. This might just be a vent, but i really don't believe it is a vent without a purpose of death. I need help, i'm chronically depressed, and don't want anyone to think of me as the failure i already am. Please help me. I'm 16, and i don't want to cry, but i find myself doing that very often now.

Let’s make a fun chain. What would you do if I sand out of tune?	2
"It gets worse beyond death.28 y/o divorced male here. With one beautiful son, and he's god sent. That being said, he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face. I've considered taking his life as well, in order to spare him.

I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic. I married my ex-wife after threatening to abort our child (we had an abortion a year before we had our son). The divorce and custody trials are still not over, have lasted over 3 years, and has put me in debt to my family trust for over $50,000. 

I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago. She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met. She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks, which have all been predominantly reassuring. This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her. Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me, in essence, that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation. I haven't slept all week, as I've felt like I've been losing her, due to the fact that I have baggage, and am otherwise more invested in this than she is. I've looked all my life for someone like her. I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this, and I thought about her the entire time, it made me hate myself and want to purify, and thus, has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line, in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation. I have a 4-year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis, but to no avail, I am living in a high income area, and am no better off than I was a decade ago. I have a huge issue with capitalism, and, coming from both a conservative and military family, am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward. I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence, took every antidepressant available in high school, and self medicated with marijuana for a decade. I can't cope with my situation, let alone another great romantic loss, any more than I can cope with the fact that I've never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions. As a single parent with full custody, options for seeking help are all but plentiful, especially with an ex-spouse eager to reverse the custody situation, who also happens to be in very dire straits financially. 

Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life, and even that of my sons to spare him pain,  my only real issue is with God. As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events, (I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder, am imprisoned, or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream), I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether, and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality. I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in, and has been in for thousands of years, I hate that I cannot be at peace, having lived a life where I've tried to be considerate of others, and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not. I've felt this way for decades, and I've deteriorated to the point of complete anguish, where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque, my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts, and then as I let my thinking spiral, I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone, but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely. No memories, no essence, no soul. Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering. I don't know how to end this, because again, in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take, but I'm so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life.

"I just need someone to listen to me...Back story: I'm 18, I've been suffering from depression for 3 or 4 years but I don't want to go back to the doctor because I'm scared that they won't take me seriously and think I'm just another teenager. I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything. Over the past couple of years, I have tried to kill myself over 20 times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself. 

Now to my current problems:

I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE's at 16. All my friends said they didn't care and all but within 2 months, I only had 2 or 3 friends that would still talk to me. When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates, about 100 people, all my old friends and classmates included, started shouting insults like faggot and queer, right up until I was 5 minutes down the road and couldn't hear them any more. My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about 2 or 3 months after this incident. My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October 2011 when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts. 
When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels, I made new friends, and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such, but then a month ago, they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me, unless they need me for something, usually to ask me for a cigarette.
At this same time, a month or so my last friends, had a baby. Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well. It's not even that they've not had time due to their child, but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves, but nothing. Now, I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I've talked to today is my mom and that was about 3 words.

I'm in love with a straight guy in my school. I would talk to him and say how I feel, but I'm scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole 25 people who are all very good friends with each other, plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time. If I did say anything, my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won't be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day. I can't go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else.

I'm also poor as fuck. My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work. My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills. I've been trying to find a job but somehow, the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me. All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old. 

I'm sorry about this rant and I thank you for reading it. It took me 3 hours and 20 cigarettes to finally get written out."	1
"I went on a full out rant in my English report writing. Basically, whenever I am asked to write an essay on a ""problem"", I express my true feelings and go on a full out rant, turning what was supposed to be a 200 to 300 word essay into a 500 to 1,000 word lecture. Four pages is a bit excessive, but once I start, I can't stop rant-writing. Surprisingly, these rants actually positively surprise my teachers, making me get near perfect scores, so it might be a good thing after all. Apparently, the grammar, vocabulary, and content were exactly what my teachers were looking for. Every single time I do the same thing, and each time I get the same results."	2
"I would rather enjoy help. If you are so kind as to provide it. So here's my problem. Last night I was eating popcorn when a piece gets stuck IN MY GUMBS. The stuff that holds your teeth.

It wont get out. I've made my gumbs bleed trying to remove it. I ALLMOST got it out but then my tongue accidentally shoved it back in the hole. 

I've ripped a small part of it off but theres still a lot in there. 

This is the biggest piece of popcorn kernal I've seen. It's super deep in. 

It's back to back on my teeth and my gumbs. 

Anyone got tips for removal?"	2

"Couldn’t believe that this would happen to me one day Me (M15) and my brother (20) had a great relations and then he opened up to me that he drank, A LOT, and keep telling me he can’t go drunk easily despite he tried a lot to get drunk. Which shocked me a lot because i thought it would have been much worse than what i’ve thought before.

Until this happened today.

He went home drunk as shit, with his friends having to drive him home. One cunt destroyed one trunk of my favourite plant while they were trying to park his car, and when he came out of the car, he looks messy as fuck, with a puke bag and pukes in his rubber mat. His friends had to get him up and lift him to his room. And when i went to my room after witnessing the whole situation, i cried. Out of shame and disappointment. And telling my Mum about this incident would have ended up him getting banished from the house, which is a horrible sight i wish i would have never seen in my life. 

Can’t believe having to watch your brother went home like this."	2

ive always been the one picked on and unloved in school, i barely got any family and was abused as a child. i just hate my life im bored of life honestly im sick of it always being lonely it kills me inside.

"I just cut myself for the first time since 2010Does anyone do this as a means to punish themselves? I can't believe I did it. I'm 28 years old and I cut myself. I'm such a child and failure.

I don't know why I have to be so fucking broken. Sometimes I am okay, and even recently I felt like maybe my life would change. I've made some major life decisions recently that at the time I thought could improve my life. But now here I am alone, hissing at fresh cuts in my left arm, drinking whiskey so I can try to not feel every fucking awful feeling in the world at once, thank you very much.

I'm just so tired. I honestly would just kill myself if I didn't have a family that would be devastated if I do that. I already ruin enough friendships and people's lives as it is. Killing myself would be the ultimate offense to the few who actually love me. So I can't do it. Ever.

But Why do I have to suffer? Why do I have to be so alone? Did I do something I  a past life to deserve this? I just wish there was a place I could go where there would hold and hug me. 

Why am I still here. Why? Ugh."	1
"Thank youHey,

Last night I was seriously considering suicide, after murphy's law has pretty much been proven for me. Reading this subreddit however gave me some strength and got me in bed. This morning, one of the main reasons that made me feel like ending it all, has gone away, and I have hope now..

Thanks."	1
"running out of optionslost my job today. let go for 'poor performance', because i am a broken failure of a human being. it does not matter that this poor performance comes partially from a medical condition and chronic pain.  

my significant other is getting tired of all the shit that gets thrown my way, most of it self made. he's constantly stressed and has panic attacks because of me. he's at work right now. he can't come home. 

it's my fault. i ruin everything in my life. i feel so guilty for letting him in. i should have known better, should have pushed him away. he'd be so much better off. 

the world is so full of pain. everywhere i look there are awful people doing awful things to others. i am constantly sad and anxious and i feel like i am drowning.  i want to get help, to try and be better, but i can't afford it. and now i have no health insurance, so the little help i do have from antidepressants and painkillers  is going to go bye bye. my state didn't fund medicaid expansion so that's a non option. my lawyer won't call me back about the car accident that left me with this chronic pain. probably decided i am not worth it. 

i am so tired. i just want to stop feeling. i want to stop existing. i wish i could just get up the courage to do it. "	1

"Just sick of it.  What's the fucking point.You're born, you grow up, you work a shitty job for a few years, you get laid off, you swallow your pride and eat shit to find more work, you meet someone you think is nice, you spend time with them and maybe have a kid or two, that person changes, you don't, suddenly they don't want to be with you anymore and your kids are caught in the middle...   

Then after all that emotional turmoil and endless working you eventually get old, get a bunch of diseases that you Wikipedia and understand exactly the way they're killing you, but it doesn't change anything and understanding it doesn't make it any easier.   Then you die, and maybe you're lucky and a couple people are there by your side when you cease to exist.   Maybe, but probably not - they have jobs and relationships to manage too and their bosses aren't very understanding when it comes to this stuff.  Being a decent human being cuts into their bottom line.

I'm sick of it.   I'm sick of having only this pointless life to look forward to.   I'm sick of being alone.   People only give a fuck when they have something to gain - even here on this subreddit, you bastards are doing this because you get a fucking masturbatory ego boost from thinking you ""helped"" someone.   You wanna help someone?   Go outside and talk to someone who looks lonely.  Stop fucking around on here.   Talk to someone who looks lonely, don't even bother trying to make it profound and interesting, just talk and let it the conversation go where ever it has to.   So what if it gets depressing, actually risk having a down night instead of coming here where you can alt+f4 the minute you start getting uncomfortable.  Actually give something.   Shit.

We're all so fucking busy with our Facebook and our iPhones and our goddamn blogs that we've stopped talking to eachother face to face.

That's what we have to look forward to, a future filled with people absorbed in their own bullshit.   

I don't want to live in that world.

Fuck everyone who's ever seen someone who needed help and didn't reach out.

Fuck everyone who ever stepped on someone else for personal gain.

Fuck everyone who's ever hated someone just because they were different.

Fuck my parents for bringing me into this shithole.

And fuck me for waiting this long thinking I just had to give it a chance.

There's no point to any of it.  At all.    "	1

"I don't think i'll kill myself over this but this will definitely up the chancesHi /r/SuicideWatch so there's been a lot going on over the last year or so much more than I feel I want to type up in a post as it could take me all day but basically I've been fighting a losing battle for a while now but small victory's are helping me get through the worst parts for example i passed my driving theory test two days ago :).

Anyway ill give you some background so you can help me with these problems, so around two years ago i was 16 got into my first real relationship with a girl named abbey about 9 months into the relationship she got really drunk at a party she got really angry at me when i told her to slow down a bit and tried to make out with one of my friends at the party needless to say it didn't work he didn't make out with her, for the remaining months of our relationship she acted extremely distant and unloving as i showered her with praise until around February last year I broke up with her. A bad and good break up at the same time as we were both extramly sad but were able to calmly talk to each other and come to an undersanding however my mother through this time told me she was  disappointed in me because I wouldn't get over her in literally two days and said she must of raised me wrong because i'm fucked up anyway.....

Between that time and now I got a job at McDonalds hated it quit got kicked out of my house got forced to move back into my house normal school issues however i don't mind school that much rampant suicidal thoughts and just generally scared of the future and sad at life. Throughout this time abbey would message me now and again and wed talk for a couple of days before i stopped as i never really stopped having feelings towards her so i couldn't talk to her without feeling like shit.

ok so here's the real problem we started talking two months ago ended up started having casual sex weekly i know great idea, said at the begging that if we chose to date people we would be ok with that and would stop this. one of my friends asked her out couple of days ago im not ok with that they went out on a date none of them told me she lied to me about why she couldn't come round and where she went. I worked it out for myself [here are the texts from tmrw to today when i worked it out](http://imgur.com/a/927HO).

 I just read through that and have left a bit out but i hope this gives the general gist of what im trying to say honestly i never fell out of love with her i don't think that's really something i can do but i know she has with me.

what should I do."	1

"Not sure what to do. My life feels like it's over.Hi I was just directed to this sub.. I'm not even sure where to begin.

I have mental problems/memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I'm sorry.

I'm also sorry for the length of the post. You dont have to read it, it's OK.

I'm 31 and have lived an incredibly dismal life. As a child I lived with a single mom, she had me when she was eighteen. She had no aspirations and not much of an education. So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I'd cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you're eight years old and your own family won't believe you have heatburn. It's like leaving me there to bleed out.  I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.

By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a ""special"" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I've ever heard. But it's still happening to this day and damaging the lives of  countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn't very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn't even have to do anything. 

In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn't have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn't have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)

"I am sick of tryingI really don't know why I bother anymore. My birthday was yesterday and it really just solidified the idea that I don't matter at all, not even a little bit. I always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since I've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. I put lots of money and effort into these parties. Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. My mother could literally care less that I exist, she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally. I am not worth the air I breath. I just take up space and time that other people could be using. I am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it. I can tell people are disgusted by me, and im so sorry that they even have to look at me. I wish I would just disappear, people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.
My other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her. But no one cares about me, maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long, maybe because im disgusting and dont matter, maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me. the only thing that keeps me here is my pet, and i mean how sad is that. That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. Im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all. Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.

"Will someone please talk me down..

I posted here a couple of days ago, x-posted in another sub with very little response. 
I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. 

Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.

 Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death. Can someone please talk to me and help me through this before I make a very bad decision??"	1
66/365 Beautiful Sunday’s, days of doing nothing, have a good night.	2
I can't go onI've been thinking about it for awhile. The pain is just too much now. I spend every night crying myself to sleep. I've made decisions that affect my life drastically that I regret, but I can't go back on. I am not strong enough to continue on. 	1
The reason you shouldn’t commit suicide, Breath of the wild 2 is coming out by the next year. If you don’t get to play it that’s just unfortunate because I don’t think There’s retailers or Nintendo E-Shop in the afterlife.	2
"I AM PSYCHOTIC AND WANT TO LEAVE THIS BODYThis is a long post, but I beg you. Any of you. Please read it, for the sake of another human. I've lost it. My thoughts are incoherent. I don't trust any of them.  I can't function day to day. I can't do anything.

I have thoughts. I don't know why I have these thoughts, I think about why I have these thoughts. I think about whether or not the fact that I'm thinking about whatever I'm thinking about means anything, and if it does, what? I don't trust the way my thoughts form. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am.

I WANT TO DIE. DYING IS ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 6. I have been depressed, suicidal since I was 6.

I'm crazy. I'm insane. Let me tell you about my day today. This is **ONE** example of a day of mine.

I drove 1000 miles with no break. Why? Because I was bored. For the first 5 hours, I had these thoughts. Thoughts of murder. I felt strange. I just wanted to murder and torture innocent people. I made specific plans to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill some women. I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. I have urges. Every moment of every day, my behavior is different from my thoughts and my intentions. It's as if two entities are possessing me; one controls my mind, the other controls my body.

My parents abused me. A lot. Every day. And the worst part? They genuinely care about me, and that guilted the FUCK out of my child self. Everything about their behavior said ""I hate you. You're worthless. We wish you were dead. Kill yourself."" and they abused my mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. But they love me. Their behavior is 100% inconsistent with their thoughts. They're INSANE PEOPLE. They are absolutely batshit insane people, beyond comprehension. They are more insane than I am, and I can feel myself turning into my father more and more every day and the thought that I am becoming like him absolutely crushes me.

I'm worried my urges will get worse. I'm worried I will do something unforgivable before I realize it. I want to die. I want the sweet release of death. Being in this mind is torture. 

I regret every single thing I have done in life. I can't believe I got to this point.

I have no friends, no family, no dreams, no motivations, no likes, no dislikes, no opinions of my own. I am a mindless drone, isolated and spending every second of every day alone with my own thoughts.

Please, talk to me. I tell myself I don't want help, but I do. I want help. I want to be happy. I want to have dreams. I want to make other people smile and laugh with them. I want to have meaningful connections with other people. But I just can't. All I do is send myself farther and farther down the hole.

I wasn't always like this. I had dreams as a very young kid. I was nice to everyone, and just wanted everyone to get along and be happy. I just wanted to be happy, to help others. But my parents FUCKED. ME. UP. THEY DID THIS TO ME. LIVING WITH THEM WAS **ABSOLUTE HELL**.

I'm crying. I'm a 19 year old dude. I look 12, and I feel like a 70 year old man with the mind of a tormented 6 year old. Please talk to me. Ask me questions. I want to fix myself. I want to be happy. I am going to get mental help in about two weeks, but for now, I just need something, ANYTHING. So I turn to you guys. Please, I beg of you. I just want to hear from other people. I want to die more than anything else, but a small piece of me doesn't.

I think its timeI have had a long 22 years of lifetime, I think its time to end it. I was an alcoholic for awhile and I relapsed, now my skin feels like it's crawling and my heart is like a racecar. I should call my doctor to get help but I don't want to, I have done it before and it helps but the thing is I drink because I find life pointless so eventually it happens again. Rather than embarrassing myself again by admitting I relapsed again I think I should just end it all. The sweat silence of death seems so enticing.	1
"Feeling at my lowestI have been depressed and down before but lately my mind has been turning to suicide more and more.

"I accidentally killed a fly with olive oil I was making a salad and poured some olive oil to add flavor. I was holding the bottle kind of high from the plate, pouring a line when a fly came flying across the plate and ended just right under the splash of oil.

"Goodbye, maybe.Hi. I’m a British born North American. I don’t have an accent. I’ve been struggling with depression for upwards of 2 years. I’m a liar, a cheat, and a horrible son.

I’ve cut myself, I’ve tried to hang myself, and I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’ve almost stabbed someone intentionally. I have intense anxiety, and I’ve missed maybe 7 months of school last year because of it.

I’m afraid of the dark, I like horror flicks and books but they give me nightmares. I like to write, draw, play videogames, and exercise. I really love my 2 dogs. I love my dad and I just texted him for the first time in maybe 2 months. He has tried his best and I’m about to (maybe) throw it all away. 

I can’t go on like this.

So either I change, or end it.

I’m scared to end it, and scared to change.

I love you all. I do.

Goodbye, maybe."	1
"Waking up in the middle of the night, weighing up the pros and cons of people caring that I stay alive.It's currently Monday morning, 3:30AM, I woke up about two hours ago, still half drunk, having had about 3 hours sleep, ate some more Xanax and smoked more weed. I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it?  


My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I kind of just wish I hadn't woken up in the middle of the night, I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing. Love (of any kind) seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment. Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me, left or died? I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now. I wonder if I'll be able to go back to sleep."	1

"I Get to be alone for a Long time.... Hey, welcome back to I tell you guys about my problems then cry about them until I fall asleep. Ready? Ok let's go


So long story short I have two best friends (one male one female) and they obviously like eachother but that dosent matter rn.

So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.

Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

Like don't get me wrong, I want to see them reach their goals and be happy and I am going to support them and I love them both SO much but its just am so scared of losing them and us drifing apart.

I'll finish hs and most of if not all of my college before they get out and that is IF they get out because... you know... it's the military.

So anyway, if my spelling is bad I cant see due to tears in my eyes so yeah.

Thank you guys so much for always giving me a place to vent and speak, you really dont know how much it means to me. Thanks for the kind words and I hope you all have an amazing day"	2
I hate my body so much that it makes me want to die19M. I feel so scrawny. I’ve been lifting for awhile and I’ve gained a lot of weight but I feel so weak and scrawny.

October 2021Everything I do seems to push me away or someone away from me. Friends stay until there life gets better then I’m left behind. I’ve changed jobs to experience new people and new environment but still feel this emptiness. How much can one person take till it’s just enough. I love to big but get no love back. I turn 30 in October. If I can’t fill this hole or find someway to maybe be happy for a chance in my life, I’m gonna just call it quits. Is it suicide tho?	1
Don’t know if I’ll make it through the nightI can’t stop these thoughts. I’m focusing on the pills, the possibility of what I can do, if what I want to do.

I don’t see the point anymore. I kept it in for so long because I knew the end result would be this. My ‘strength’ was questioned, when every single day has been a battle not to kill myself. Now I don’t see why I shouldn’t. I’ve never felt so humiliated and depressed in my entire life.
I’m currently in the process of hiding away pills to take. I want enough so that they won’t be able to bring me back, like 50 or so.
My family know I want to kill my self so they’re hiding my antidepressants from me and only giving me one each morning, but there’s cold and flu tablets everywhere that I’m ferreting away. I hope to do it in the next few weeks."	1

"Hate my meds, but I can't live without them.Fucking venlafaxine. Without it I'm always suicidal, but with it I sleep upwards of 12 hours a night, and feel sleepy and unfocused all the time. Ican't get it up, can't cum on the rare occasions I do get it up, even though I've been off it for a while now. Neither way is actually living. I probably get a grand total of two productive waking hours when I'm on it, and off it I get none because I do nothing. I can't keep up with this world, I tried getting help and it made nothing better, I'm just a burden on everyone either way. 

On venlafaxine I didn't want to kill myself. I wanted to try other things. I wanted to try an alternative, I wanted to try supplementing it with modafinil. And my psychiatrist said no, because he didn't get that while I might not *irrationally* want to die any more, in that state it's a fairly rational decision. 

What the fuck do I do now? I was staying alive for my girlfriend but then she got sick of me being so tired and useless all the time. I'm just done, I'm not staying alive for anyone or anything else. "	1
"angry and frustratedeverything is just too much for me right now. this pandemic has driven me back into a deep depression after months of working on myself and bettering my mental health; everything is shot back down to stair 1. i’m not making enough money anymore; and won’t be for the next few months because of the pandemic. i’m turning 21 this summer and I wanted oh so desperately to move out so I could finally have a taste of adulthood...I have never been able to live on my own because of poor mental health and inability to find room mate. but my mental health was getting better and I finally was making enough money to where I could move out without needing a room mate. i also am so embarrassed and ashamed i live at home; it makes me feel like a loser. my mom is worsening my mental health bc she is now unemployed bc of the pandemic and constantly at home. all she does is nag me and treat my issues as trivial nonsense and acts like she will not allow me to move out...my mother was never strict but ever since I started college she became anal and insanely strict...i’m an adult...
I also am having severe anxiety because of corona and everyone dying is making me upset and paranoid. I want to work because I cannot not be making money, life is way too expensive to just quit but working is stressing me out bc i’m putting myself at risk to contracting the virus
my car also is conveniently breaking right now which is just the icing on top of the cake. 
i’m crying and angry and shaking and I want to cut myself but I know i’m way too old for that, I don’t have enough of any drug right now to abuse it...I just feel hopeless and scared and I don’t want to be here anymore. this happens every time: I have a breakdown and get suicidal, get my act together and life starts going well, then something happens and shoots me down farther than I was before. I just don’t see a point anymore"	1

Is it weird to fantasize about your own death everydayI've been haunted by the feeling that I'm only wasting my life and contribute nothing good for society. maybe i think too much and i tend to overanalyze things but its just one thing that i cant help. im so tired of disappointing people and getting myself disappointed. my only escape is fantasizing my own death frequently each day, imagining how great it must be if i could just suddenly vanish and leave this world in an instant because here, it never gets better.	1
"Everything just feels shit.I'm a 15 year old male who is suicidal. I told my mom and stepdad that I was very depressed and they laughed and said that I wasn't. I've also told my friends and one of them just thought I said it as a joke and my 2 other friends are too depressed to get help from.
I have been depressed since I was 13 but when I turned 15 I got suicidal. I feel lonely and I think about how I should kill myself when I'm at school or when I'm eating etc. 
I almost never sleep for more than 2-4 hours per night which makes me very tired at school and I only sleep in class. 

I don't really have a good reason for being suicidal except that I hate the way everyone lives, wake up, go to work, get paid, go home, eat, sleep and then it starts all over again. I also feel like i'm such a dick towards everyone, as I don't care about anything anymore, some people are annoyed by my negativity towards everything. 

Being alive is just pain and suffering. I've almost stopped feeling emotions at all, I don't feel empathy towards people anymore, only for animals. Now at school i've just started pretending that everything is alright after someone said that I was emo or something like that and now it's just too hard to ""be happy"".

Wtf? What? The? Fuck? So I'm just supposed to accept all those years of molestation, accept that because of my abuse I'll never be normal? I'll always have depression, bipolar, anxiety, PTSD, fucking *schizophrenia* because of what happened that was out of my control. I'm gonna be miserable all my life even when I'm happy as can be and I'm supposed to be *grateful?* 

I go to therapy, I worked on myself, I made all the right possible decisions I could and still do. *Fuck* even my psychiatrist told me ""you should recognize how resilient you are. Most people who went through what you went through would come out in a lot darker place, if not dead. Youve done everything *right*"" Everyone says this to me who finds out my story, despite my loving personality. WHAT??????? I DONT WANT TO BE RESILIENT I WANT A CHILDHOOD BACK WHERE I WAS LOVED AND NEVER HURT.

"I have GOT to stop this damn rollercoaster, one way or another. Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable events.I feel as though there is, at this point, no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions. Sometimes, I have a hard time hearing people and I'll just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents. This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours. Also, while in this state, I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation. Usually, other people are completely confused, unhelpful, or downright mean and mocking. It feels as if some people never left elementary school.

I have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers. This makes the fluctuation between ability to focus/listen for understanding and distraction/anxiety even more frustrating and unpredictable.

Some backstory: Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture. I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me. I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied, can lie, do lie, to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing. The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence, a balance everyone sits somewhere on. It is the latter desire to hoard 'precious' objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and [Gaslighting]() that has planted the seed of, first, my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and, second, the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science (and CLEARLY religion) are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are. Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility, especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter. I'm sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but I'm starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of 'coincidence'. For example, I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads ""I need a Job and clothes"". I (clearly incredibly insensitively) joke to the girl by saying, ""Hey, yea buddy I need those too..."" Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly: ""You don't need it"". We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the 'synchronicity'.

These things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way. I was not raised religious in any way and, in fact, was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticism.

I am very serious, I NEED to know exactly what you believe and **WHY**. The why, preferably, would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me, and undoubtedly more redditors, to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisis.

Much love for you all, I look forward to your excellent powers of deduction. Yes, I am in a humorous mood, this is not always the case and my emotions can become so acutely anxious that I really don't want to ever feel that specific pain again."	1
time flies guys I was at wrestling almost 24 hrs ago. I’m not sure what happened and how all that time passed so quickly. I’m headed there again soon. I have a match soon next week. I’m nervous but also pretty excited. We’ll see how this goes. Does time ever fly by for you guys?	2
I understand why transgender suicide rates are so highI’m never gonna be cis, never gonna be cured of dysphoria. Honestly don’t think I’ll feel better no matter how long I’m on hormones. Will always be ostracized and a target for violence. Therapy can’t even help with this because there’s literally no changing the fact I was born wrong. There’s no point in drawing out the suffering. It never gets better. I’m going to kill myself. Holy shit. 	1

The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that Im scaredIm scared that it will hurt. Im scared of hanging myself because I know thats painful for at lest a little bit before youre gone. Im afraid of jumping in front of a train because what if I dont die right away and suffer until I die- and who knows how long that would take. Im afraid of jumping because im afraid of height in general and again, what if I dont die on impact. I cant shoot myself because I dont have a gun, but even then maybe Ill fuck it up and die from bleeding out or something instead dying the second the bullet hits me. I don't want to live, but I'm just too afraid to die	1
"I could have graduated this week but I ruined all my chances... this is it for me, I'm doing itI've been struggling with depression and social phobia for the last years, and although suicidal thoughts have been recurrent, this is the first time where I feel committed to it.

I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday, but I have not been able to type more than 800 words these last months. I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).

This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. 

I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am. Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.

So yeah, I am ashamed but this is it. Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible.

Thank you for reading this and sorry for taking up your time. You all deserve the best."	1
"Best ways to ask someone out? So, long story short, theres this one girl I like and we’re hoping to start hanging out in March, since our parents will have been vaccinated by then.

I’ve liked her for a bit and would like to try to make a move when we start hanging out again. And that’s where I’m stuck.

I’ve heard a lot of different things, and don’t know what to do. So I though where else would be better than here to get advice.

"I feel numbI'm the person people go to if no one else is available, and I can't blame them. All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy life anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down all the time. I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now."	1

"I don't know why I'm even writing thisI don't even know where to start... I guess, I feel guilty for even writing this. I keep telling myself I don't feel that bad, I should get over myself, I have friends who feel worse than I do... And then it all just escalates and keeps on escalating until I tell myself I deserve to die... I don't want to die, I'm terrified of death, but at the same time I also feel so indifferent. Whenever I think of death I feel terrified and then I feel bad because I should want to die.

It's gotten to the point where I have thoughts of just ending it. My  brothers both have really busy schedules, to the point where I'm left alone by myself all the time. I've decided exactly how I would do it, and where. I just haven't ever decided when. I want to live so bad... But I'm scared I guess... I don't feel alive. I don't even know what I want. For a long time I've told myself I'm not depressed, I'm just making myself think I am, but then I wrote my mom a note about wanting to see a therapist for another problem I have and it all came flowing out I realized how badly I need help, but I don't have the courage to actually make anything happen."	1

"The wildest shit happened at school today So because of this whole Coronavirus and that we learnt that a Year 7 caught Covid and apparantly 50 other Year 7s needed to be sent home. We learnt this during lunch, so people were kind of nervous. Then the teachers started calling out names of the people in OUR year who had been in contact, and they got asked to go home. Now everybody's running around the lunch hall, screaming ""AAH THERE'S FUCKING COVID IN THIS HALL"", even after the teacher told everybody to calm down and sit down. There were kids screaming ""WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE"", ""WHAT IF I HAVE IT"" and an array of swear words that will get me banned from this subreddit.

TL;DR: Year 7 caught Covid, lunch hall was in panic, Jesus it was a day."	2

"Dear reddit, after taking a look at my life I realized that I have no-one to talk to.and that I was instead the one others come to for solace and comfort so now that I need that, there are none who are willing to offer it.

I have nobody, not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood.

Speaking of moods, I'm in a fairly dangerous one. Not for others, mind you, I don't believe in harming other people for no good reason. My mood is hazardous to my own health.

Most days I'm suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain. Today I find myself quite lacking in caution, self-preservation instinct, and the ability to care whether or not I live or die.

On top of all this I have work in about 1 1/2 hours and I'm not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularly.


EDIT: Oh right, lest we forget, the biggest reason I can't talk to anyone is because they're all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems, especially if I decide to stick around. It's a crappy loop that screws me over time."	1
"How do you convince yourself to not end it?Ive been living with depression for about 8 years now. Since I was 14. I've been suicidal off and on but these last few weeks have just been really hard, and I've just been thinking about how many people live to be grandparents while being depressed the whole time.

So my question to you is, what mindset do you have to put yourself in to make the bad thoughts go away, or what's your reason for staying? "	1
"I want to end thisI just turned 21 and things are getting even worse. Now I've got to a point I cannot even look at others face directly when I'm in public.

People I thought I was friends with, turned out to be fake and literally no one contacts me first and even I do first, they always ignore me.

I was raised by pretty averaged parents, no traumatic events or something  but I'm here, having social anxiety, BDD and depression who literally can do nothing but cooped up in home all day long and constantly thinking about how horrible human being I am.

I have literally zero self-esteem that if someone said something mean to me I don't even get pissed because I know how horrible creature I am more than anybody else. At this point, death seems the only way to get out of here."	1
To whoever is thinking about suicide and sees this.Even if it feels you are alone, that no one understands you, that you are so worthless to the point that the world is better off without you. Just stop. And think clearly about what you are doing. There are many people that would be sad to see you go like that. Even if you don't know that. One of your family or friends, pets, some complet stranger that you accidentally smiled to and helped them relive their stress, or even one of your fellow redditors that are kind enough to care about you. I know i do. Even though i never knew you. Knowing that a human died when i could have stopped that with a few words of encouragement would surely bring me over my breaking point. Well, just make sure to think about everyone that would love to help you before you do anything you might not live to regret. Please.	1

"Hey, Lar...[home](http://i.imgur.com/8nD5j.jpg)

Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe. Yeah, I get it: your own parent not wanting you. After you died, Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance. 

She left me with pedophiles, more than one, with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they'd take with me the second she left. Even if she was in the next room, or taking a quick shower, I was the fuckdolly.

Did you know that one of them was at me for years? Yeah, he'd kill my pets to keep me quiet. Another one of her boyfriends. Had my childhood dog, EB, for years...he drowned her in the bathtub. He killed several. Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was ""completely satisfied"". Yeah, she managed to throw this in my face when she found out - jealousy over maternal instinct. She's a fucking abusive cunt. This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me, not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years...aside from the times he was in and out of prison.

Know how all this came out? He knocked me up at the ripe old age of 13. I had to have an abortion. He was going to be charged with several things, not just for the sexual part, but unlawful confinement, too. 
Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance, even before the pedos...telling me that she wished I'd never been born, screaming, ""Are you fucking retarded?!"" if I did something kids normally do, such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes. Enter her violent blowups, slaps, punches, being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously. Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn't even see it coming. I lived in constant fear in childhood. I acted out...not knowing how to relate to others, alienating my peers at school. No friends...the girl everyone scorned. There was no comfort when I was told ""No one likes you!"" with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day. You have no idea how this has isolated me...fuck people. Not going anywhere near them. Isolation is my greatest defence. When you have it drilled in your head that you're unwanted, it sticks so deeply. It burns into the deepest trenches of your being.
Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she's from. Think that went well? You know the one...where they're tighter than thieves. I was so beaten down and shy, of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them. I couldn't even look anyone in the eye, I was so shy. The curled their upper lip when I'd pass by. I did nothing to deserve this. I never hurt any of them, I'd only wanted to be accepted. It didn't help that her next ""husband"" tried to convince me I'm crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn't talk to anyone. I love my mom, no matter what she did, and I'd call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies. I hated him deeply as he was a bully, and knew she'd do anything in her codepent, clingy way to keep him. He'd told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught...told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn't walked in the room. He'd sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he'd had served time in a criminal psch ward, and arrogantly defended his actions, going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her. Whenever he didn't like someone, his first comment was that ""there was something wrong with them in the head"". Holy fuck...pot calling the kettle black or what, eh?There's can't really be anything truly wrong with me...I was just kicked around too much, wasn't I? Please tell me I'm not crazy...it's eaten away at me for years. I know rationally I'm not crazy, but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me. I was truly happy when he died...he was evil. I'd rather have O'brien and the other pedophiles than him. Fuck, everyone thought he was so ""nice""...good old ""uncle rick"". Piece of motherfucking shit...even his corpse is a waste of space.
Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died? She was supposed to save it for me, but spent it on herself, a house and her boyfriends. I was lucky to fucking eat, or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes. She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty. I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing. I nearly finished my degree, but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me. Postpartum depression and the stress of it all, I've tried to be strong.  The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born. I gave birth to her, going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship. I struggled against depression best I could, but I dropped out three times over the years, each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating. Three strikes, I was out. No more access to means to finish. No jobs to cover tuition, loans wiped their hands of me, understandably. My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face. Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them, but not one practical skill from it all. Nonetheless, you grandkids - You'd be so fucking proud of those two...hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you, certainly not her. I know you'd have spoiled us...Mom told us that you really, really loved me more than anything you'd ever in your life. I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were, you'd be twice as much over them. Nonetheless, we struggle...I've been so isolated for most of my life. O'brien, Mom, that hellhole she dragged me to, settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years, not a soul to turn to. Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out, connect and bond with anyone. We're stuck in poverty...there's no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town, and even if there were, I freeze, paralyzed when I try to interact. They won...I get it: I'm stupid, I'm crazy, and I'm unwelcome. I am not allowed to be, life if for ""other people"". 

From what Mom tells me, you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me...I was the apple of your eye, you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by. Fuck, all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to your little sister, without telling her my intentions, and she'd be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me. They're better off without me, I'm so fucking stressed out and scared all the time...snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world. They'd be better off with her. They're the only things I love in this world, but I'm no good for them. Daddy, please...I'm so fucking scared...I'm so fucking shoved away. I tried, I really truly did. I've tried to get education and make things better...I've tried to be the best person I can, but nothing helps. Please...take me back to  you. Just hold me in your arms, make it all go away. I've given it my best shot, but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down. I can't go on like this. I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home. At the time I could afford it, I had a gravestone made for you as I'd spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered. Your own father...my mother. Both had the means to do so, but hey, it was all about them, you know? I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you, proudly carrying you with me forever, so you know that yes, someone loved you sincerely. I can't do this anymore, however. I've struggled and tried to do my best. I just want to be back with you. No one wants me here, I'm not allowed to live and shouldn't be. I'm not welcome, I'm unwanted...got it. Loud and clear. PLEASE Just take me back home to you, Daddy,I've tried so hard - just take me back - I don't want to be here. PLEASE, I fucking beg you...

"Today was badI really don’t want to get into it. There have been a few close calls. I’ve held a gun to my head and a rope around my neck but i’ve always failed to follow through. My coworker and I did everything right today. But we still get reamed out by the boss. I don’t know why i’m so angry. I thought I would be able to calm myself like I always do after a rough day at work, But today just keep getting angrier as the day goes on. I’m enraged but i don’t know why. I know I’m not going to kill myself. I know i’m not. I feel like a fraud posting here, like. There are other people that need to vent, I don’t even know if i’m going to hit the post button. Other people that need to be talked down from the ledge. I joke a lot about how I might kill myself. Nobody ever takes me seriously. I make sure of that. I do know that joking about suicide can be a sign that someone needs help. I can’t afford professional help though. I always ask people that joke about suicide if they need to talk. Nobody has ever taken me up on my offer but I do hope that they would come to me if they needed to. 

My biggest fear is that some day I might kill myself on accident. When I have that gun to my head I may be so enraged that I just pull the trigger and then nothing. I don’t want my parents to find me. I really don’t want to die. I don’t. And I think I have my emotions under enough control to not do anything stupid, I thought at least. I am not going to kill myself. I just need some room to breathe I think 

I just can’t stop crying"	1
"I hate my health...I'm 20 years old, male, and I've got problems.  I grew up in an abusive family, and I'm still living here.  I'm about to postpone college so I can move out, but those are little things.

My health has been failing for the past several years.  I've developed a shit ton of food allergies... I can barely eat anything, and with what little I can, it's impossible to get all the vitamins needed for my body to function correctly... and that leads to even more problems, and it's alot more than you might think at first... The list of things I can eat is literally shorter than the list of things I can't.  Even trace amounts of food that I can't have will trigger a response.  If someone drinks out of something, then kisses me, I'm screwed for about 2 months.  At first, I'll be in pain.  The other symptoms are almost like having the flu, and then I'll be extremely tired.  Sometimes I'll pass out one day, and wake up two days later.  I'll be very tired like this for about a week to a month.  The pain will last a day, sometimes more, but it's the more visible effects that get to me the most.  The skin on my face will explode into pimples and my entire face will be covered with a red rash.  This is the part that lasts for about 2 months... I've been to 4 different allergy doctors, a dietitian, and a dermatologist, and none of them could help me.  The longer I avoid the foods, the worse the responses seem to be... and they're almost inevitable.  If a dish isn't washed well enough, I'll react to it.  If a knife was placed on a counter, I'll react to whatever it's used to cut.  Lots of fruits are covered in a corn based wax, which I react to, and even companies that I'm used to buying canned tomatoes or anything as basic as that will switch their ingredients before they switch the label, then there goes 2 months of my life.  If I react to something 1 out of every 100 days, then 60% of the time, I'll have to deal with these symptoms.  On top of that, I'm also diabetic.

It doesn't end there either.  If I get sick, it usually lasts about 5x-10x longer for me than for other people because my immune system is focused on tracking down pollen and food particles; so it doesn't invest anywhere near as much resources to fight bacteria and disease as a normal person's would.  I'd give more information, but I'm already pretty identifiable as it is.

Lately, I've been really losing touch with reality... my problems are so unrealistic, I question them myself sometimes, but they've consistently proven themselves to be real....  I've held a gun to my head 3 times since december, but I've been too pussy to pull the trigger...  I heard of a cure that might work, but it's illegal in the U.S. and costs over $3k, and my parents refused to fund it, even though they buy and rent out houses for a living... she rubbed it in my face too.... I'm really not sure my sanity will last long enough to get there myself.

I just feel completely fucked and betrayed by my own genetics.  I've read plenty of books about my problem, and I've done alot of research determined to cure myself, but again, my sanity won't last me that long... sorry for the wall of txt."	1

I’m never enough.I think I’m gonna try again. I can’t do this anymore. I’m inadequate. In school I was the weird kid no one wanted to fw. I ate lunch in the girls bathroom the majority of 8th grade. In high school I attempted suicide multiple times, one of the attempts landing me in a coma for 3 days. But I’ve been to the psych ward countless times. I’ve been to dbt therapy, cbt, and I’ve tried so hard to get better but I can’t. It ain’t my life because I have a pretty decent life. I live in the US, am a sophomore in college, and despite my families money issues, my parents have parented me to the best of their abilities. It’s just me. I am never enough as I am. I don’t fit in with people, and no one will ever love me enough to marry me. I’m pretty, but my personality sucks so much I don’t see why anyone would ever want me. And even if there was a possibility I’m done with hope. Whenever I have hope, I get hurt in the end because I expected too much.  Sorry I just needed to talk to someone since I can’t talk to nobody I know in person about this.	1

Hi i'm new to here.Idk how to use.nice to meet you all.	1
"I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice
Is that the right term?? This is what I mean:

As far as I know, my school’s never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn’t be SURPRISED. 
I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. 
I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didn’t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years 😭😭

If I killed myself, all those kids would think “She really did it” and would say “WE drove her to this” and kids at neighbouring schools would say “You know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide” and “A girl from (my school) killed herself!” And “Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking “Oh it’s (my name) so it’s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it’s nothing” and now she’s dead.”

Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasn’t there.
I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout “GET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE.” in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. 

No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. 

The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, I’ve been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?

I don’t want to stall too much so that I’ve left school when I do it because then the school won’t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn’t because of them. I don’t want the wrong people to be blamed. 

I don’t know how much longer I can go on. It’s like a candle is burning, and I don’t know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn’t much. 

It wouldn’t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour."	1
"I want to kill bullies, not even my bullies, any bully.I want to kill everyone who harassed me throughout life. Realistically, I can't kill them all at once without getting caught in the process. I could settle on killing 20 bullies and then myself.

Also, when I attended elementary school, sometimes they'd place me in an in school detention room and each kid was always black except for me (white), I was usually sent there by the teacher who on several occasions purposely bent over to ""help me"" with my school work and her shirt would be loose and expose her breasts.

I am foreign to US and didn't know the English language very well and my family were far from helpful. I felt very helpless and I was unable to tell any adults. I still feel very fucking helpless, and I'm 21."	1

"I’m committingToday I learned that no matter what I do I’m bound to fuck everything up. Today I committed to a plan of action that, with any luck, will lead to my death.

I’ve bought tickets for a gun show a month away, far away from where I live. Since I’m 18 that’s the only place where I can buy a handgun. The time delay is for me to make preparations and psychologically as well as philosophically justify what I’m about to do to myself, to come to terms with my own death. Finally, I’ve quit school. Besides being too much to handle, this will burn the main bridge tying me to being where I’m at.

Regardless of my intentions and how far I’ve come, I’m better off without this miserable existence and the world is better off without me. "	1
I'm too scared to do it but..I'm too scared to actually kill myself, I'm scared it'll be painful and I just can't, what I'm actually gonna do is I'll completely destroy my life, I'll fuck everything up the worst way i can, i already used to do drugs sporadically but now, since I have really easy access, I'll just go with it and fuck everything up, i have these crackhead friends that have their own place I used to go to do drugs, i literally could move there if I wanted to and just live like that, I'm just done with trying	1
"Im so fucking worried that i did something wrong to my friends But I don't remember doing anything bad, I mean, i never ask them for weed, or money, or anything like that. I never talk shit about them. I never argue with them. So wtf?!

My friends used to always say good morning, they used to hug me, they used to invite me and even beg me to come out with them

But suddenly, my closest friend stopped talking to me. The only fucking reason they even acknowledged me is because I offered them alcohol first

And now, my other friends stopped talking to me, too. Theres only 5 people left in my entire fucking school, who I'm not even that close with, (of like 30 people) who acknowledge I exist. Even some of the teachers act like I don't exist

Some of them legit just stare through me. I can't fucking handle this again

I'm so fucking confused at what's going on and idk what to do, I'm gonna ask my old closest friend if I did anything wrong tomorrow, but what's next? 

Idfk but I just wanna cry and maybe die idfk. I really hate this"	2
"I have a small penis, I've never had a gf nor do I think I ever will. Don't know if life is worth living.I'm 26 years old and other than the woman front my life is going great. I'm graduating med school next year. However, I have a pretty small penis, and I feel like this is the main reason that at 26 (almost 27) that I've never been in a relationship. It's not that I'm not confident- I've read books on how to have the best techneaque, I perform oral on command. Please don't try to pass me that bullshit that size doesn't matter. I've twice had women, after seing my size, decide they aren't in the mood and go home, and never talk to me again. I've heard pleanty of lady friends talk about various guys with large ones and how great they are. ""Size doesn't matter"" is a lie made up by women to try to seem less shallow than men, when in reality they are just as bad. I think we have convinced ourselves that everyone who no longer wants to live is mentaly ill, but I don't buy that. If I knew for sure that I would go my whole life w/o a relationship, I would not want to live, and I don't think that makes me mentally ill. "	1
"For everyone who came here looking for help.This is something I stumbled upon writing one of those days, yes we all know, one of THOSE days. Its a hard outlook on life, but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better. I post this in hopes to help you. It's very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors, but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me, so I did my best. And Best of luck to you all. I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth, you can make it through this, just as I did. Because you start seeing things as no overall point. If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking ""risks"" and with risks comes ""reward"". You won't even notice it at first. But it will be there.

I would have to say, to one guy, just one guy, there is no point. No point. None. I simply don't see how you can disagree, you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details, you can't. I dare you to try, I dare you to tempt fate. It's simply put at that, there is no point. It's all just there, you can't put it together, you can't write it out, because if you were to try, there would be no point. Do you get where I'm headed? Of course you don't. Because I'm headed no where, because there is no point. It has been shown over and over again in every way possible, people are just to blind to see, that they put words to it to try and make sense. But yet, there is none. No sense. There is nothing this world wouldn't give, to fill it with sense. To give it a point. There is no knowledge, there is none. How can you possibly say you know, when you yourself haven't known before. Can you just simply believe it, because they tell you so? There is no knowing, there is no point. I'll try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon, and believe it to be real. It's trial and error, guess and check, nothing else. There is no point. So how can we all decide, what to put behind this? When you yourselves, don't know.Is there such a thing as success, or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope, turned into our reality. How do you know?.....  How do you know? Take it to yourself to think. Has the hope and thought of success become something, the one thing, that we all humans agree upon? Letters and numbers. It's all just how we put together the everything, the everything of nothing. There is no point. We simply must agree that there is no such idea. How many times must it be shown to us, that there is no point. There is a such thing as nothing, and it is everything that we see. Just what we have agreed upon makes it something. Why can't we allow the thought of being ""unhappy""? What makes it unhappy, and to whom? Does that really justify what can make one happy or not? Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being ""unhappy"" that we seek happiness? But can it really be sought? How can you deny something to not be right, when it never leaves you? It never leaves you, it will always appear, and come upon us. So can we embrace it, can't we all just let it happen? Why do we continue to escape it, when all it does is return, harsher, as if it were angry at us? We have left it for too long. I have left it for too long. I will not change, I will not cheer, I will not forget that it is here. It's inside us. The only thing you have to do is look deep enough. When faced with the chance to escape it, I will, just as we all would, but I will not forget. I will allow it to come back upon me. I will surrender to it. Maybe, just maybe, it won't forgive me. 

Even now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be ""unhappy"" I probably wont call it this for very much longer, because its not really being ""unhappy"" its more of human nature. We have grown out of ourselves, we have become distant with our nature, our true meaning and being, the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it. We are just here, and we cant accept it now. Its been too long, why oh why cant the people just see? We aren't here for a reason, we just are, it happened, so what. Live with it, there is no need to find this out, so there is no need to find anything else. Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you ""happy"". It's more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing. We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding. We will never know, so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject. I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist. However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far.  This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day, because does it really matter? Does it? Back to being a toy. We are all one, we have no right to do otherwise, we need to find what we can do, and do it. No questions. Don't think about what you do. Just do it. If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it. But what you are doing is what you must. Because that is what we have given the title, ""happiness"". What we are made to do, individually. But its simply beyond that, the concept is made up. Its just to keep us in our places, but we have made it be for so long, well that happiness has become something, and with anything that is something, there is always the opposite. We made an opposite to nothing, something that isnt there. So how can we break from this cycle? Well just remember. No feelings. Do what you are meant to do. We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is. And follow it, but once feelings get involved, you need to drop it. and think again. It's something that must be done. In order to break the cycle. Of which we have named, ""Depression and happiness""."	1
I need to talk to someone right now.I drove for 3 hours with no destination in mind because I was trying to clear my mind from suicidal thoughts.

I am not at my best state at the moment and everyone I know is busy.	1

"sick of pretending to be ok but I have toIt’s so demotivating having to pretend to not being super fucking sad all the time. The few times I did vent my issues all the advice I got was “fake it until you make it.” It also led to some family arguments and an ADHD diagnoses. 

So one ADHD diagnoses later I’m on pills which make me concentrate more but also make me feel worse. I need to keep saying I’m okay so the family doesn’t get into more arguments. The only thing my brain is telling me currently is “you’ll sort it out when you move out.” But I can’t wait that long. I’d rather die than live like this. This is gonna sound really fucking weird but sometimes I just wish I were a fox, I wouldn’t have to worry about any of this shit. I just fucking hate who I am and I want this to all end. I’m so fucking disgusting and I don’t know how anyone tolerated a personality as fucked up as mine. I’m so annoying it’s impossible to ignore even my friends have to tell me to shut up every once and a while. I fucking hate my body I don’t want to thinkanymore."	1

"I'm going to kill myself by the end of this monthI'm a 19 f. I've contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre-teen years, anyway i never did it 'cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking, not my brain. Now, years later, is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed. I've, for the first time, analyzed everything with a critical mind. Life just makes no fucking sense. The way the world works, is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with, im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can't get a job. Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is. I've been trying to get a job since i finished school 3 years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience, you are ugly or they just don't fucking know you. People here only hire friends of friends. I can't push myself here 'cause. Here's the thing. I can't talk. This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember. I don't know how to talk to people . I can't express myself, i can't even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit. i've had social anxiety in the past, i've been homeschooled the last 2 years of high school. All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills. I've always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i'm now. I always hated everyone for not liking me. I only have one friend, and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to. I mean don't even ""talk"" to them, i just answer whatever shit they tell me. BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living. I fucking hate myself. I can't believe I lived so long without realising it.I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me. I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away, i never did anything nice for anyone. I can't fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone. I never hugged anyone honestly. I've never been to a party. I've never told anyone that i liked them, I was never told neither. I've never kissed anyone. There are so many things i never did 'cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn't worth it. And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame, im so miserable. i hate myself so much for it. The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can't cause i was never given the tools to do so. I was always alone. I don't know how to reach out for anyone. I honestly don't know what im supposed to do. My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me 'cause i never did anything with the help she gave me. She is fucking right, i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me. I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone. I have problems, i'd went to the therapist before, i've had like four different doctors over the past years, but they never helped me 'cause i never told them anything, they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me. Now i have no money to go to a shrink. I have no job, my brother doens't have a job and i just can't do anything to get one. I have no parents nor family besides my siblings. My sister who was the only support i had, decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month. Im fucking desperate. I have no tools to face what is comming. I don't even want to die. There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am. I don't want to die, i just don't want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i've become. i can't ""un-become"" me. i don't know how, i don't even think that that's possible. i hate living in my skin.

I just wanted someone to know this. How i am feeling. To hear my feelings before i fade. I won't send or tell this to any of the 3 people i have left. I know they can't help me. The only person that can help me right now is me. but im not able to. i gave myself an ultimatum of 10 days left to figure it out. if i don't find a solution on this lapse i'm going to kill myself.

p.s. : ironically i've always wanted to be a screenwriter but I desisted the idea because my writing sucks.. so i'm sorry for whoever tried to understand what i just wrote here.

"I have been very fortunate in my life. There have been times where I have been sad or  frustrated, and there have been people luckier than me.

But now in my current situation, I feel an existential sadness.

I’m leaving the house I was born and raised in. I can look anywhere in my house and see a memory. A past me. 

I’m leaving behind my best friend, a dude who I have known since... forever. I literally can’t remember a time where I haven’t known him.

I’m leaving behind an array of elementary school friends who’ve been so kind to me over the years.

I’m giving this all up for a new chance at a new place. It makes me sad that I will never see a majority of these people again."	2

I have a best friend, whom I love very very much, but constantly feel like I have to emotionally babysit. I have a boyfriend whom I love but honestly can't feel comfortable with; my fear of him abandoning me makes it hard for me to relax and enjoy our relationship. I have lost two best friends whom I can't seem to get over or forget. My father, the only supportive parent in my life, has cancer. My mother is a complete c*nt and manages to make me feel guilty for existing despite me knowing full well our damaged relationship isn't my fault. I fear all of my friends really hate me and are putting up with me. I feel like school just isn't worth it. I'm so busy I don't have time to go see a doctor, or therapist, or go to the gym (exercise makes people feel better sometimes). Despite having 3 jobs I have money problems. Almost zero me time. 

I want to die. But I'm scared of dying painfully. I want to die peacefully. I hate waking up. I don't want to feel this way. "	1

Party on fridays, sit on the beach after midnight kissing girls. I can only dream. Fucking fucked off about how other people are luckier then I am. Cunts. Fuck them all.  I've had it, I have no groups, no friends to turn to, cause they're all fake assholes. Never ever ever ever ever chat to me on facebook, nothing, no likes, no friends no nothing.

"Just exhausted of continually feeling this way, and it's not bound to get any better.The past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me. In the time that's passed, I've experienced the following:  
* Experienced the end of my first adult love, leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me, and even if they did they'd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway
* Lost the majority of my friends after this, and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I've been reluctant to reach out to them.
* Almost didn't graduate from college but barely got by, and found myself neck-deep in student loan debt.
* Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet, while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another. This has gotten to the point where I don't even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding.
* Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use. Also generally work graveyard hours, but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all.
* A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful, frequent headaches
* Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major, but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt
* Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day, to a point where I just don't want to deal with it anymore.  

I'm just so *tired* and I can't see this getting any better. The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened, but as time passed I started leaning more towards it, quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home. The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won't have to see them, because it always ends the same way - with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances. I don't have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either, as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I've regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back. I did want to further my education, but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring, along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring.  

I think I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to tolerate this anymore. I know I'm on the younger end of the spectrum and there's the unknown that's waiting for me or whatever, but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take, and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once. I hate to think of using it as an easy way out, but at this point I really just don't want to deal with the pain, depression, and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day."	1

Personally, suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week. I think to myself that I'll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then. It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore. Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it. But as each weekend goes by, I get closer to overcoming the fear.

So why can't other people, especially strangers, give their blessing when someone expresses their wish to die rather than try and talk them out of it right away?"	1

I’m So Tired Of TryingI’m 39 F. All my life I’ve been different and unattractive. Growing up I was told that eventually I’ll be normal and then people won’t pick on me as much about my looks, but that hasn’t been the case. I refuse to leave my house because I’m tired of people staring at me or making ugly faces when I try to smile at them. I feel like I’m just bothering everyone. By now, unless I miraculously come across a lot of money, my looks aren’t going to change and unfortunately will probably get worse now that I’m aging. It makes me feel like I’d rather be dead then endure another 40 years of misery. I don’t have the courage to hurt myself, but I wish all of the time that I’d not wake up in the morning. 	1
Just got shouted and had the door taken of my bedroom for and I wish I was joking not taking a shit quickly enough God my family’s fucking pathetic	2
I feel sick I’m so hungry I can’t eat I need help but I don’t wanna ask for it and I have counselling tonight for the first time and I’m nervous, but hey at least Google’s working again	2
"when you have to accept that your parents will never accept youmy mother is probably one of the most invalidating human beings ive ever met. when i first asked her to see a therapist she told me to work out because that would make me stop feeling so sad. when she first found out about my cuts she yelled at me. when i attempted she got angry and told me i was selfish. 

i will never understand the people who say they stay for their moms. if anything, she would be the reason why i couldn’t do it anymore. shes the catalyst for so many of my problems and everytime i even mention my depression or ask her to set an appointment with my psychiatrist she asks “do you really need it?” and “why are you sad? youre happy when youre around us. ” 

she doesnt even notice when i wear hoodies in the summer to hide cuts, when i isolate myself all day, when i cant even eat. she’ll ask me “why dont you ever leave the house?” and then get mad at me if i do. 

ive accepted that she will never truly care about me. she will never validate me. she will never be there when i need her to be. 

im gonna go listen to mitski."	1

"I know what is after life and I want itI had an NDE in 2009 after an ATV accident and I remember the afterlife. It was so beautiful. No pain, complete and utter peace(for lack of a better term)

My  Life is similar to a vacation where you’re staying at an acquaintance’s house and they tell you “make yourself at home.”
But you’re still a bit uneasy, and you still tip toe around because you know you can’t get too comfortable, and no matter how many accommodations they can provide, you know that 
It. Is. Not. Your. Home.
It never will be. 

I will be going back home this Friday the 22nd. I already have a place, time,and plan. 

Thank you all for your encouraging words and support. "	1
"The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don't want to be selfish.. but I really want to do it.For the past 4-5 years, I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt the lives of others.  I know that if I killed myself, I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it.  
So, I guess it's good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others, but that's not the issue here.
I just don't want to live. I don't like life.  I know that if I were more ""optimistic,"" I could maybe have a better life.  but, I've tried being optimistic and that doesn't work out, either, because I always end up disappointed.
I've gotten to the point where I'm just faking life.  I do what I need to do to fit in.  
I know it's been five years (ish) since I've felt this way, but I'm wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say ""screw it"" and do it.  I also attempted, once, about 5 years ago (when I first started having these thoughts) and one of my close friends (no longer close) helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions.
So yeah, I realize that other people would be disappointed.  But I want to do things for myself. Well, I guess by that, I mean that I want to do this one thing for myself..
I hope that was coherent. Your thoughts/reactions would be appreciated.."	1
Life is funny.You'll go through life. You'll find happiness and disappointment. You decided some things were better left alone and some things you should have put more effort into. For all the good you could be trying to do, even those who means the most could still only look at the worst parts of you and think you're nothing. No part of life wanted me and i never wanted any other part of it. Im tired of going through everyday. Day and night no matter what I do or try and push myself towards i feel nothing but emptiness. Like a ghost in this world with nothing left to lose. I wont lie I am severely depressed. I can see how worthless my life had to become for others to move forward so easily. They walk away from you only seeing the worst in you when you had only good intentions that turned out the wrong way. I wanted to do more with my life, to be someone who could still have meaning, but it wouldn't be worth it. Nothing could change could it? Im tired. Everyday i imagine the sweet release from the bullshit that is life. From the bullshit people put each other through. What's the point when it really wouldn't make any difference?	1
"I hate my life So this week has been very shitty, and Ive had lots of bad weeks.


I don’t even know what to do anymore 


The son of my moms best friend snitched on me for helping him. 

I hurt my moms relationship with her 

My parents found out I’m vaping

I have nobody to talk to at all 

I have been banned from going out on my bike, to the the basketball courts, anywhere really without parental advisory. 


I have no electronics anymore, besides a TV that doesn’t barely work. 




I feel so fucking alone and honestly if I didn’t have family and friends I’d kill myself right now. I feel like such a fucking failure, hell I am a failure. 


Everything I do always comes back to kick me in the face. 

My parents are fucking angry at me and I mean very angry.

Even trying to explain that vaping isn’t harmful in moderation, they believe the media’s bullshit on how horrible it is. 


(Before you go off on me for vaping, I wanted to cope with stress and I wanted to build up a nicotine tolerance so I wouldn’t be tempted to use cigarettes because a bunch of kids in my group smoke.) 



I just don’t know what to do, help me.

The loneliness is killing me."	2
"i'm losing all hope. it's not getting better. quarantine has ruined my life.i didn't have friends to begin with but this period of quarantine is making it worse. at the beginning, i was dating someone who didn't give a fuck about me. and only talked to me when he was horny or no one else was around. i had ""friends"" but i only mattered to them when they needed something. i cut everyone off. making online friends has been a dead end. people want to pity and infantilize me and it makes me feel worse. i can manage myself just fine. i'm just fucking lonely and i'm tired of doing the same things over and over. i don't have the energy to care about politics rn because i'm too privileged for people in power to even pretend to care about my issues. i feel guilty for even complaining because others have it much worse than i do, so what right do i have to feel as hopeless as i do? i even feel bad for saying i'm tired of hearing about politics constantly. i feel bad for admitting i don't have the energy for it. i'm fucking drained. 

i'm so tired of it. i keep forcing myself to be productive just so that i don't feel entirely worthless. i sit in my room reading, drawing, studying, writing for hours on end; but when that's all over, what meaning does it hold in the end? i'm losing my grip on things that i shouldn't be. nothing is giving me hope anymore. this situation will only get worse. i keep fighting with myself to stay productive but it means nothing. i'm sick of the same thing day in and day out. this is giving me too much time alone with my mind and now, i'm in the worst mental space i've been in for a long time. i never thought i'd be this close to rock bottom again."	1

"I Survived but...after several tries, i came the closest that i ever did. I OD on a shit load of pills, and was dead by the time i made it to the ER. I was revived and placed in a coma and woke about 5 days later. 

I am mixed about making it. I find that it is still a battle day to day, sometimes I am happy I made, sometimes not so much.

However there is one thing, I feel like i have fundamentally changed. It is really hard to explain but its like a part of me didn't come back. But rather is just sitting there dead. My feelings all seem very superficial, I can laugh, smile, cry, yell, but nothing seems to truly move me. 

I am hoping that maybe there is someone else out there that has gone through this, or can help.

thanks"	1
I don't know what else to doI don't want to reveal much online, because people frequent Reddit and might know me.  I've been on and off of antidepressants for the last couple of months, just being messed around constantly.  Every day I get frustrated at myself over my situation, the way I am and how I can't tell anyone.  Honestly, i'm sick and tired of everyone telling me it will get better, whether it will or not.  The point is, I don't know anything any more, and I can't tell my family because I'm scared of how they would react.  I already know that they don't like people like me so I need to keep my life under wraps.  They're all the most loving, caring people, and every day I feel so incredibly guilty that someone like me has this kind of family when other, more deserving people don't, and so scared that I will lose everything I've ever known.  And, every single day I think about how good it would be to just let go of everything.  I already take things sometimes that I shouldn't take in order to forget about life for a few hours - I might zonk out on painkillers for a while, or take a packet of nytol to escape reality.  I'm not an addict - I could go without them, but I choose to take them every now and again because I can't deal with the way things are.  Cowardly, I know, but that's me in a nutshell.  I so desperately want to get better but deep down I know it won't happen so I don't know what options I have left. 	1

"It's All My Fault.*No it isn't.
*

**Yes it is.**


I'm in a strange emotional state right now. I don't know how I should be starting my story.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say. But I'll try to make it as clear as possible.


My house has never been one to display much affection. Thats not to say we don't love each other, or someone is overtly abusive, but emotions are not shown very often (do I care too much? or maybe I don't care at all and I'm faking it.) As a result, communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often. Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here (parents were refugees from Viet Nam).

My father never graduated high school. He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church. All his life, he has done manual labor of some sort, and currently works as a mechanic at a self-owned (although beginning to fail) mechanic shop. Despite all this, he will never *ever* pass by an opportunity to help someone, whether it is through money, work, or otherwise. In my eyes, he is practically a saint, despite some minor flaws (gambling, which he has fixed, and a little bit of drinking). This is because no matter what, he will help and expect nothin in return. He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face, even though it may end up costing him. Throughout my childhood, he was (and still is) working six days a week, from 7AM to 7PM at the shop, and sometimes even as late as 9PM. He works all day, and he works hard, even though the business is meager, he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home. Because he worked so much, I could never see him  often, and as a child, I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect, but I never quite knew why. Of course, now that I have grown older (19) I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up. I love him more than words can explain for it, and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer. Don't get me wrong, he's still healthy and alive, but I just wish I could get closer to him, but I dont know how. At all. And it kills me.

My mother was one of the ""boat people"" that fled Viet Nam, leaving her parents when she was only 15. At only a week out to sea, however, her boat was caught up by a Chinese (Hong Kong)? patrol boat, and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong. Thankfully, because this was towards t he end of the conflict, they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America (due to political asylum or something. I can't recall). When she arrived (living with her aunt/uncle who were already here at the time) her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school. After that, she perservered and went on, despite having limited English skills, to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist. Again, my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people, even if it costs her, as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives. (However, she has a quick temper. And I mean quick.) On one hand, I guess you could say I'm closer to my mom than my dad, since she had more education, so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general, but on the other, I just felt that there was always a kind of ""barrier"" between us, as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn't have with my mom.

I know this is getting long, and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly. I just want to note that at this point, I have mostly calmed down, and my thoughts are getting more lucid. However, I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out. Furthermore, the nature of my ""issue"" is something that has and probably will recur constantly, so, while I am in control of my thoughts, I figure pre is better than post.

As you can see from my descriptions, I hold both of my parents in very high regards, to the point where, when I was younger (and to a certain extent, even now), I could see them do no wrong. Growing up, everything I did, I did it to make them happy, to please them, to constnatly seek their approval. And even now, I see nothing wrong with that, especially when I consider that everything I have now, is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide. And I am truly, eternally  grateful. I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children, providing them with the same (albeit unspoken) love and care that my parents have shown me. I have learned so much as a person from each of them, the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father, and the necessity of knowledge, determination and respect from my mother. Again, I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid. However, this is where the problem begins.

Even at a young age, if my parents ever fought each other, or got mad at me or my brother (regardless of fault) I would blame myself. I would not tell them I blamed myself, but in my heart, I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault. And thus, I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them.This worked fine, until I'd say starting about 5 or 6 years ago, when family issues began cropping up.

As I mentioned earlier, my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect. My dad is very quiet and softspoken, and often will take t he blame, in order to diffuse any situation. (For that, respect him immensely. Seriously. His ability to maintain composure was astounding.) When my brother began to reach *that age* where everything and everyone is out to get you, a lot of fights broke out in the family, because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and ""americanized"" my brother was becoming. Needless to say, fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down, and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure (but of course, blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together. As I said earlier, from my dad, I developed a kind of ""do everything I can"" mentality towards my family. I refused to become a broken statistic). The fights grew in number, and volume, my brother became more rebellious, my father began getting tired, etc etc.

Fast forward to the present. I know this is getting long, and to be honest, everytime I write something, I realize I have more to write, but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard.

my dog keeps staring at me like bro ur not allowed on the couch stop staring and whimpering pls	2
Not sure I even have the energy to type thisBut here goes. I tried to kill myself last Saturday night. I took 15 pills of codeine and valium with whiskey but evidently it wasn't enough. My girlfriend broke up with me and I thought it was over for good but she came back and talked me through it. It wasn't just the perceived end of the relationship that I attempted suicide over though, that was just the last straw. I've had derealisation-depersonalisation disorder from smoking weed for 14 years and severe OCD for 13. The former manifests as agoraphobia and I have been stuck in a rural shithole trying to get help for it all from a local health trust in special measures for almost as long. Everyone I ever love leaves me. I seem to always piss my girlfriend off just by being myself. She is the only good thing in my life but we can't have a normal fight, it always has to end with a potential breakup and tonight she seemingly doesn't want anything to do with me again. It's my fault but I just don't know how to fix it. All this ha sort of compounded to the point where I just don't want to be me anymore, even if I'm nothing. I'm not good enough for my girlfriend, I am too mentally ill to contribute meaningfully to society and I fucked my one chance at a good deeth last weekend by taking too many but also not enough pills so now I'm just slamming my head against shit and jamming knives that aren't sharp enough into my arm. I don't even know why I'm typing this.	1
"How do I stop feeling stupid I always feel stupid around people, except my friends.
Every time I'm with my dad and he tries talking to me I always answer stupidly like I'm nervous and it's not what I even wanted to say or I do something without thinking, I feel like I'm being judged the whole time. I accidentally make the wrong decision for myself and when I'm asked why I did it I have no idea how to answer because I know I'll look stupid.

I feel as if on the outside I come off as this serious and well thought out person but then I open my mouth in public and ruin my whole ""image"". This feeling makes me want to crawl into a hole and never come out but after a while I get over it and stop thinking about what to say. This makes me think that the reason I'm a quiet person is because I know I shouldn't open my mouth otherwise I'll regret it later."	2
Finding the right hair style is so hard Seriously though I hate my hair I used to have a bowl cut ffs because I thought that it shouldn’t be hair that matters its personality. I got bullied no surprise. So I got my hair shorter because I had a crush and now people say I have a mullet even though I don’t. The thing is though I can’t find a hair cut that suits me I look awful in images.	2

"Day 2 of keeping a digital journal so I don't go insane I guess you could technically call this a blog? I have no Idea ANYWAYS

I was in bed restless and went to bed at like 4:00am unfortunately no dreams tonight but then I woke up at 8:30 turned on my computer for zoom joined my first class then immediately went back to bed. I woke up later and was like 10 minutes late to my 2nd class but I didn't care because the teacher is pretty annoying and always started the class 5 minutes late anyways so I stayed up for a couple of minutes entered a breakout room and took another like 20 minute nap when I woke up it was time to leave and so I spent lunch in bed and on my phone

After that I got up did my morning stuff then came back to start my second class once that was over I put my dog outside and responded to a bunch of reddit comments I got and the occasional text I then proceeded to scroll through instagram and have a fucking aneurysm over the among us memes I then proceeded to contemplate my existence 

Moving on I played some botw instead of doing work during my fourth class and my mom cam home for lunch brought me some food from a new local mexican restaurant it was pretty good I watched some youtube and ended my last class

I joined a new discord for an artist that I follow on insta really friendly crowd then played rocket league and now I am currently doing homework even if I stopped to write this I also read the latest issue of the Down To Earth Webtoon and man could I relate poor kade. Anyways im thinking of trying to get people to VC with me since I kinda don't wanna be alone atm I hope your day was a lot better or exciting than mine if you read through today as well have another cookie 🍪 tell me about your day down below"	2

anybody know of any good suicide hotline #s?I wanted to know if anyone had a good suicide hotline that they've  called personally? the last time i called one it seemed to do more harm than good, and I dont know where else to ask. I think the one i called was the generic US one from like the first google search and I don't want  to call someone shitty again. Thanks:)	1
"I literally cannot stop laughing. In my public speaking class, we were given an assignment to write a speech over any topic that we wanted, as long as it was at least 8 minutes long. On the day of the presentation, she called up the first person, and he walked up onto the stage, and I kid you not, this was his opening line:

“What makes Shrek such an amazing movie?”

THEN HE PRECEDED TO DO AN 11 MINUTE SPEECH ABOUT WHY SHREK WAS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE. I am literally dying. Like you could’ve done your speech over anything and you did it over the financial and cultural success of Shrek. You have my respect."	2

"I want to burn every bridge.I want to burn every bridge, every friendship, every relationship, and any other reason someone would care for me.

I want to become a vile person that people will rejoice when I take my own life. 

The current problem is too many people would miss me. So, my idea is if everyone hates me then it will make my passing easier.

I realize I will have to go against my moral code of ethics, and have to lie, cheat, and steal. However I am more than willing to do this and beyound if it would mean I could kill myself in piece. 

I have wanted nothing more in life than to die for 22 years (give or take a month) i am in therapy, see a psychologist, and still have a handful of people that cafe for me.

My second goal is now to make people who would give me the world, and make them never want to hear my name again. 

Being in the mental health system for over 2 decades the only skill I have acquired is to convince peope that I am not going to do it. When in reality I am just not doing it now. 

With multiple attempts under my belt I have decided the next method to test my luck. I've had 3 close calls, and doctors can't explain why I lived. Except for the Bull shit ""it's not your time"", ""life has a purpose for you"" or ""you are not alone.""

I want to be alone forever for eternity. 

My purpose is to die, as all that are born are cursed with dying

I Don't want friends.
I Don’t want to be saved.

I domt understand thisIve had a 'good' (by my own standards) last couple of days, had motivation, got shit done etc. Yet rhw tgoughts are still here, i havent really felt down, but still had a bit of that numb feeling, but not as much as usual. Why? 	1
"I’m just ready to go.That’s it. I’ve been contemplating this and that, but at the end of the day I just don’t want to do any of this anymore.

"I'm beyond hope ugly, so why *shouldn't* I end it?I'm revolting enough that every woman I've ever asked out has gotten angry that someone so ugly would bother. Not beautiful women, but women I thought were plain-looking or somewhat ugly too. One girl went out with me out of sheer pity, but she couldn't bear the ugliness after a few days and broke it off.

Even my mom reminds me of it every time I call. I'm 33, so she shows my headshot to prospective girls and their moms. She relays their extremely hurtful comments to me, and I am starting to think she knows how devastating it is to hear, and *wants* me to off myself. I realize the shame in being the only one of your friends whose son isn't married and has never had a girlfriend at 33. Financially I'm good, am average height, not fat, dress well, but my face, oh god.

Even when I avoid calling home and the awful thoughts start to go away, I'm bombarded with romance in almost every TV show or movie I watch, no matter how male-oriented. I'll be doing fine for weeks and then some love interest on the TV will send my mind into hysterics, never shutting up about dying. I might even just screw up at work, and my mind will just melt into a jumble of never-ending ""boil yourself alive you ugly dumb fuck"" thoughts.

I've tried hobbies, but the ones I've gotten into all involve people, and I can feel the disgust and hate, or sometimes sympathy, people have for me by looking at me - I've dealt with it my whole life, from being punched in the face and pinched as a toddler to being treated extremely coldly by teachers despite being extremely quiet and being top of my class. I even tried religion it's too fucking hard to get into paradise. I'd join my local Freemason Lodge but that involves a lot of speaking and it turns out I'm complete shit at that too.

Honestly the only thing stopping me, and it's quite big, is the work that'd go into it. I don't want anyone cleaning up the mess so it'd have to be in the ocean. And I'd have to clean out my apartment and find a place for everything. But lately I've been caring less about that all and a bottle of some illegal sedatives starts to sound pretty nice.

Surely there's some reason ugly people like me find to stay alive? How do they keep their mind off their ugliness? Any tips? Good hobbies where I can avoid the anxiety?"	1

"Need advise to deal with some piece of shit students from my class. First of all, we still do online school so no it wasn't physical bullying or anything like that. It was during an online class when I decided to raise my hand and read a paragraph. Keep in mind we can't enable cameras. Afterwards as i started reading it for whatever reason my voice got a little deep( this might sound stupid af) and it sounded like I started yawing for a second (it wasn't yawing). After that I cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it. Around the end I hear a message notification and after I ended the paragraph and I muted my mic I opened my phone and saw the message. It was a gif( this gif: [https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF](https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF)) and as you can probably see it is someone getting slap through his phone. I ignored it but afterwards someone reacted to it with an emote that is yawing. After that i asked my self, DID THEY REALLY THOUGHT I WAS YAWING. You may think this a stupid reason to make a post. But the person who reacted to it is one person i trusted. Also the guy who posted the gif made fun of me before, I'm really tired of it. He is going to the gym so i can talk back or anything or else he is gonna beat me up and everyone will support him because he is the ""popular"" guy. Shit like this hurts my feelings and I am a very sensitive person. I have all this rage inside of me when stuff like this happens but I can't talk back I don't have the confidence. I am the quiet kid you may say ( No I'm not a school shooter, I hate that meme) and if I talk back who will support me?. You may say talk to a teacher...NO. Maybe I am overexaggerating but as I said this not the first time it happened to me. Not  only from that person but some others to(but he is the main reason I'm tired of this shit). School never made me excited for this reason. It makes me fucking depressed. Any advise will help, please."	2

"No future. What now?I'm just so lost right now. 

I grew up in a poor family. My sister just found that she can't afford to go to University. So, to put her through, my dad is going to mortgage the house so he can pay for it. But that leaves none for me to go to University, or collage. 

I can't go to school. I have to move out the day I graduate (I'm graduating this year), but I don't have any money at all. I'm not allowed to get a job during school, and I've been trying to get a job all summer but no one will hire me. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. When I finish high school I'm on out the street. No job, no money, no place to stay. I can't go to collage. What am I supposed to do? I don't want to kill myself, but it seems like the only way out. I'm lost. "	1
I want to die but I don’t know how to approach and say goodbye to the girl I have feelings for.I can’t do this anymore. I finally decided to give up, I’m no longer anxious to die.

I’m a piece of garbage who can’t stand seeing people be happy because my life gets shittier day by day. This world doesn’t need people like me and I’m doing everyone a favour. My final wish is to get one final glimpse of her beautiful face. I don’t care what people think about her, she’s beautiful and i’ve always thought she is. We’ve been looking at each other for 7 years through primary and all the way to middle school. Not a single word we spoke to each other and it’s my fault, she tried to approach me multiple times but I ignored her because I was shy and anxious, she probably hates me now. I once eavesdropped her and it turns out she likes someone else. She lives next block, I don’t know how to approach her, confess everything and say goodbye. She deserves better anyways.	1

"I’m trying so hard to get betterTo start off, if I could only receive constructive comments and no “I relate to that”, “I feel the same way” etc because I can’t handle the weight of other people’s struggles right now, because I can’t even handle my own. Thank you

I’ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. There’s never really been anything bad happening in my life. It’s always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. I’ve been in therapy since 7th grade (I’m now in 10th), but I definitely could’ve used it sooner. 

I’ve been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. I’ve self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says I’ve been making really good progress over the years, but I’ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I can’t deal with my gender identity, I’m constantly doubting wether I’m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. I’m disassociating really hard every day (I’ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I don’t even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can’t even comprehend who’s thoughts they are. I’ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. I’ve always felt like there’s something else wrong with me that hasn’t been diagnosed, but maybe that’s the hypochondria. Thus far I’ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I haven’t self harmed in awhile, but it’s just because I know it doesn’t really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that I’m a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that I’ve shed a few times, but now I’m stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I don’t even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. I’ve been on autopilot for so long. I’ve tried to get better for so long. I can’t remember a time that I wasn’t mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, it’s like that’s just how god designed me. 

I’m tired of people telling me “it’ll get better”, “it won’t be like this forever”, “you can keep going”. This is all I’ve ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I can’t see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I can’t escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I can’t even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so I’m probably not gonna kill myself anyway. It’s too much to plan and I know I’ll probably forget something important. It’s permanent and drastic, and I don’t do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

I’m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or I’ll suddenly realize something, or I’ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if they’re personal. I’m desperate."	1
Can someone write a fanfiction about me I'm bored, and I just want to read dumb things (or sexual)	2
"I just need someone to tell me I'm okay and I just want to believe itNo long post like last time. I'm just so angry and sad and I don't know how to help myself in healthy ways anymore. I self-harm. I've done it less lately, and I feel worse when I don't do it. It's the only thing that helps. On my other alt account all I do is fly off the handle at people I think are assholes, but maybe it's just me. I feel like I'm never going to be better. I'm just me, and this is how I am. It feels doomed. I don't know how to interact with people anymore. Nothing is enough. I thought seeing my friends would help, it didn't. It just reminded me how lonely I am. All of my problems are unsolvable because they're not even real problems. They're just me. I need to be loved, just a fucking hug, anything, but I can't ask for help from anyone I actually know. I go back to work in 2 days and I know I can't do my fucking job anymore. I'm snapping. I've been snapping for months and it's finally happening. Help.

Sorry.

"How do you motivate yourself to get back up after some type of disappointment I (18), had this test at school and I had spent days studying for it. And I was really hoping to do well in it. Well, it turns out that everything that went wrong, went wrong. I made countless errors and coming out of the test and hearing the answers my friends got in the test, I feel like such a complete dumbass. I feel like I have been kicked in the balls and it really hurts.

It really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day. I this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when I know I am not. I work hard, I am committed and I invest a lot of my time and energy into my academics. It just really sucks that this type of thing can happen from time to time. And when it does, I begin to feel like I am less than or something. I have been told in the past by my sister that I should just calm down and stop overreacting. But setbacks like this sometimes leave so dejected that I just don't see the Pont of putting in the grind anymore. I have goals and I know I can achieve them. But I just sucks when you look so dumb sometimes.

I was just wondering if anyone has had this feeling or is it just me needing attention.

Thank you for reading 🙏🏾"	2

"Last night was a big revelation So I used to really like this girl,let’s call her Sophie, and last night I think I never stopped liking her (it’s been like 3 years), I just stopped trying and it happened because I was at a party for my band section and she was there and we were talking just about anything and everything and I just kept getting lost in her eyes and just her being there.

But for the past few months I’ve been liking this other girl, we’ll call her Em, and I’ve been slowly losing feelings and realizing that she’s not worth it. 

So old feelings are resurfacing again and I think I’m gonna ask Sophie out soon, because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right?

The main reason I’ve been losing feelings for Em is that she’s just been dry, leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours, been distant and just seems uninterested. As far as I know she’s okay, but I dunno if shes worth all the effort I’ve been giving. 

So yeah last night was a big thing for me and I think it’s good"	2
"I can't speak.Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

I don't think it will be very long now until I take the plunge."	1
To the people who just told your crushes that you like them: I commend you for your bravery. It is something not all of us can do. Mostly because we're all too socially awkward to even know someone to have a crush on if that makes sense. Idk	2
"I tried to kill myself the other nightI don't really know how to talk about this. Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up. 

I feel sick because I haven't eaten again too. But it doesn't make a difference, I'm still fat. I'm not losing weight. 

My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am. I tried to run outside naked in 4 degree snowy weather and throw myself into water. I didn't even make it outside. My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee. The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am. 

I've been married for six years. I've been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four. Ex boyfriend. Yeah, look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex. 

My husband is an INTJ. He loves me deeply but he's terrible at showing it. He's very neurotic. (read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you've got his biography). He's also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac. His upbringing was conservative-Christian-style abusive, and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything. I'm ESFJ, I try to keep everyone happy, but I guess I'm shit at it. I rarely clean because I'm always tired. Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Some days I just can't anymore. Those are the days we fight. 

He loves me, he works very hard for our family. I just feel very lonely and not understood. Or that he even tries to understand. He just wants the fight to stop, but also to ""win"" it. To explain to me with anger-skewed logic how I'm wrong nomatter what, in the heat of a fight. When not in a fight, he still doesn't know how to do things make me happy even though we've been married for six years. Even though I know how to make him happy. I've tried to tell him sweet things to try, he'll do it for a day or two then forget. I feel so lonely. 

At some point I'd started cutting, but rarely. Maybe once every few months, then a year or two between. 

Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I'd been ok with it, our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much. He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too. I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life, and the connection was instantaneous and intense. We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days. He understood me, the way he thought made sense. We had the same interests, liked the same games, liked the same themes. My husband was jealous that we had so much in common, but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn't complain much. 

My boyfriend was my social life. I told him everything, though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another. We moved around a lot, so I wasn't able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years. Well after he was already over me, though he always said that he loved me. 

We kept moving, then I got pregnant. He was sure I'd disappear, but I didn't. 

No one would hire me pregnant. I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby. Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me. 

My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was 8 months pregnant. The birth was traumatic for me, the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn't need. The new baby was colicky and miserable. My husband's job was hell, the commute was hell. I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend. Then the job cut everyone's already spectacularly low pay down by 25%. We lost our apartment. I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother. (borderline fundamentalist) My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute, for shit pay, while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office. He had sleep apnea and wasn't sleeping. He was in hell. 

His mother is a hoarder. I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick. I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell. He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump. I was supposed to be illustrating a children's book I hated. I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don't like looking at it. Talking to Seth was hell. I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give. We would be snappy and miserable at each other. So I stopped talking to him. My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it. I talked to him a ridiculous amount. I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone's unending stress, and talked to him while I tried to work. He loved me then, dearly. He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together. It was unrealistic. 

Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays, then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around 11pm. He would be tired and angry and snappy. He didn't want to look at the baby. We would almost always fight. He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous. He didn't have his girlfriend anymore. It was the ugliest time in our relationship. It was the ugliest time in my life, except for now I think. 

Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth. My boyfriend didn't manage well. Suddenly that constant attention was pulled. I couldn't be on calls much at all. I had less childcare and I was severely depressed. My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too, after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months. It was rocky. For awhile my boyfriend railed against it, fought to have me back like we were before. Even if my husband hadn't be jealous, that could never happen. Not without leaving my husband, and through it all I didn't want to. I still loved him. He couldn't ask me to, but I know my boyfriend wished I would. Its a natural selfish thing we all do. I'd been unfair and told him things I shouldn't have, told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband. It wasn't business to share. I'd planted strife between them. 

I'd always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever. He'd pulled away, gotten a lot more quiet. He didn't respond to everything I said anymore, instead I'd be writing pages to myself. That was around two years in. My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh. We moved for the fifth time in the 2.5 years I'd known my boyfriend. We got an apartment. I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything. Also having a 1.5 yr old toddler was tough, and my relationship was still strained with my husband. My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from. We were making plans to meet. 

Then I found out I was pregnant again. A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly. Who knows if I'd been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow, I'll never know. It was dangerous. They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused. I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn't in danger of ectopic pregnancy. Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant. He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people, e-clubs. He still played games with me, and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit. I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn't do it. I'm pretty sure that was the moment it was really over. 

The pregnancy was miserable. My husband doesn't do well with small children at all. Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably, and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together. Even though I talked throughout the day every single day, my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring. He'd offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days.

I wasn't carrying a baby it seemed, I was carrying a nuclear bomb. It was a long, lonely, miserable pregnancy. I cried so much. When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean, this time because I'd been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis. It was my fault. 

You can't have a trip with a new baby. You can't have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you're breastfeeding. While family is constantly in and out. While my life was hell. At least I'd thought so. I should've just let him in. I'm practical to a fault, but I don't think he was even that interested at that point. We still talked every day. We played games together. I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life. I held onto him, and he was sort of there, but I railed against the distance that was so plain. 

Finally, we made plans. The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days. We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live. My husband's girlfriend would come up to meet him too, a girl he wasn't much into anymore either, but wanted to give a chance. Just weeks before the trip, my boyfriend had a heart attack.

It was the true end, because when he wrote about it on his FA, and that girl from before attached herself to him. He began talking to her constantly, more than me. Roleplaying with her, doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new. She was married too. She just didn't have children. 

He talked to her for months. She began posting pictures of their characters fucking. She told me to my e-face that ""it wasn't like that"" and she ""respected my relationship"", meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new ""boyfriend."" 

I'd postponed the trip to October for him to heal. It was for two weeks. It was pleasant but he was distant, and had issues making love to me. He spent a lot of time on his phone. The second week my husband's girlfriend came up, and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow/birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine. It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn't know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me. We had a fight where we had to talk it out. It was awkward. 

The rest of the trip was ok but, the second week was stressful and messy. I'd made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend. It was too much. 

At Christmas I found out that they were together. She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together. I got very upset. Then I got dumped. I cried, I was told at first that I had been chosen. The pictures came down. We got each other Christmas gifts. 

Then they all reappeared. And he chose her. I spiraled. It was the worst Christmas of my life. I spent hours on the phone with him. The first few times were sweet and caring. Eventually he couldn't keep the facade up anymore. 

He plastered her on his profile immediately. 

I cut myself. Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling. At some point before then I'd figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning. It wouldn't make me feel good, but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold, lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt. 

I took a break from the computer. Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday. I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband. He was happy to ""have me back"" and since I wasn't outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better. 

A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend, still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again. Then she posts about how he had visited her. In November. Immediately after seeing me. 

I'd been cheated on in the flesh. 

I found out about a week and a half ago. I called him. I cried a little, but I was mostly numb. He didn't sound very sorry about it. I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me. He said he would. He barely tried. 

I cut again. Four stripes to breathe. 

Then a few days later he leaves to go see her. He's at her house right now. Fucking her. I was stupid, I kept looking at his profile on FA. As long as things weren't being posted maybe it was going badly. Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared. He knew I was following him, so even if I hadn't been checking, they all flooded my feed. I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it.

Imagine if someone got a divorce, then a month later when his ex found out she'd been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together. 

It was the final blow. I've never felt so ugly, so fat, so useless in my life, or so alone. My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it. The time I do spend is away from my children. My house is a shitpile because I don't clean. 

When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad. I was angry and tired. I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile. I snapped. I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up. He didn't like it, he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical. I ran downstairs. I've threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo-chamber fights, he didn't even follow. Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs. I told him to fuck off. He tore into me verbally, I tore back. We worked each other up until I was done. I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds, to actually care. Just fucking correct until I gave in. 

I ran for the door. I was naked. I tried to get it open but he stopped me. I ran for the other. He stopped me again. I ran a third time and got it halfway open, he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed. He held me down until I gave up. 

I should've gone to the hospital but I didn't. 

He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn't do anything. 

I asked my ex to call me, he said he would then he didn't. 

I'm not worth it. I'm not worth bothering with. I'm not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air.

I'm so. sad. 

Sorry for the life story. It doesn't really tell that my husband is a good person, that my boyfriend was too... He said so many sweet things... but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were. That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful.

Some days I don't know how to keep going. The house is getting steadily more disgusting. I'm getting snappy at the kids because I want to do nothing but sleep, but I don't get the option. 

Its too hard."	1

"Advice needed For transparency, this is about my teenage daughter.   She is 18 and started college last Fall. 

She is very introverted and has a very hard time making friends.  She is extremely smart but also very awkward and has very little self confidence.   

I’m trying to help her come out of her shell and get out and meet more people.   It’s just not working.  She stays in her dorm room all day .. she rarely sees her roommate who shacks up with her boyfriend.   

Any suggestions from teenagers out there to help her?  What could a parent say to you that would help?  Anything?? 

Thanks for your advice!"	2

"This grocery store encounter was a little too ironic and must be shared So i was in a grocery store near the house, when a old man, most likely in his late 40s, wearing a MAGA cap with the American flag on the backside of his electric wheelchair. Heres the ironic part, tho. He was wearing a face mask.

 a. face. MASK.

Im not sure if he was wearing it so he can grab what he needs without a fuss, or if it is for self preservation, but this boomer, with patrioticy coursing through his veins, wearing a face mask while Karens claims that not only do face mask take away american freedom, but also suffocates people and does nothing against the virus

Hey, i thought i wouldn't be here againSo, my girlfriend of three years broke up with me new years. I found a lovebite on her neck from someone she'd previously fucked whilst we were together. I cheated on her 3 times, and in these past few months i've been feeling better. My cheating came from insecurity, i think. I just don't know what to do. I'm bipolar, and can't help but read into everything, she's out with a guy i think she fancies tonight and i've been drinking to help it (i know, its not helpful) but i just don't know what the fuck to do. I know the relationship wasn't great but that doesn't help.	1

"I'm not suicidal, but I need some help and advice...I really hate living at home with my parents. I'm 21 and without a job because I was convinced by my parents to go to TAFE and get more qualified to go into the industry that I love, but now it has left me over qualified for anything that I apply for and since the tech industry is small in my country... the market is empty. I apply for ANY job and I mean anything, retail, cleaning and janitorial, sales and marketing. Shit I don't even know a thing about just because I want a job so everyone can stop rubbing it in my face and making me the butt of all their jokes even though i'm trying as hard as I can. I'm also told that I can't have an opinion on anything, I tell them that they can save money by shopping at a store we have here called Aldi as apposed to Woolworths and I just literally get told this, verbatim from them ""You can't have an opinion on this subject""... i'm told that I can't give them suggestions because I don't have a family.

i also have some problems with them accepting a phobia I have where I can't leave the house by myself without having a mini panic attack, here is the story of what happened pasted from another thread.
&gt;About 4 years ago, A friend and I were walking home from a coffee shop, We would have been about 16 at the time and I spotted someone that I recognised... It was a person that I had been having dramas with at school and he was running full tilt at me, Luckily for me I was walking past my school at the time and it was open for a play they were putting on. I ran as fast as I can into the school and got a teacher, called my parents to come pick me up.
I should also explain why I was having dramas with this particular person... Myself and his brother(who was in my year) both have hated each other for about 2-3 years before all this happened. One day he stole my phone and I knew where he lives, so we went to his house and got the phone back. I later learned that his mother had sent him to live in another state with his father, because of that and now his brother blames me for it.
Ever since then his brother has hated me and now I have really bad anxiety every time I leave the house. I can't catch the bus home from TAFE because he rides the same bus as me and he gets off after me. We don't live far apart (2 stops) so I get worried that he might get off and hit me. Whenever I talk to my parents about it they just tell me to get over it because ""He probably doesn't care about you anymore"" and call me a pussy and faggot but where I live we have had a recent spat of one punch deaths and it makes me scared to be put in that position where my life could end with one punch and it frightens the hell out of me. So instead of catching the bus straight home (it's not walking distance), I go and see movies and my parents pick me up from the theatre, but they have stopped doing that because it is a minor inconvenience to them. I have told them why I do it, but again they shrug it off.
It's not like I'm depressed though, I would never take my own life and the fear actually is because I don't want to be put in a situation where my life could end, I'm actually a generally happy person... I have some really good friends(Who I haven't told about this because we really don't talk about problems) and I have made some new ones at my TAFE course. I have anxiety and it runs in the family but no-one understands how I feel because mine was caused by something other than just thoughts and it seems like they quite frankly don't care. I don't want to talk it through with him because I don't want to run the risk of reminding him just in case he did forget about me.

So I want to move out but I don't want to live with other people I don't trust. I live off of Centrelink welfare payments while I find a job but it won't be enough for a decent living out of home especially me living in Sydney, one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I don't ever swear around my parents, EVER. I feel it is disrespectful to swear around people but it has driven me today to tell my mum to fuck off and say it multiple times today because of how they make me feel. So that is how serious I feel.

I asked a GP about the anxiety and stuff and she referred me to a psychologist, but it's WAY too expensive and my parents won't help me with the money because they don't give a shit anyway.   

I guess I just want some advice on my current situation and just want to reiterate, I don't have suicidal thoughts, I love life most times. Just when i'm home life drags me down when I'm reminded that i'm useless for wasting my life so far."	1

"Don't even care about a throwaway right now...I feel like a 15 year old looking for attention... I feel so stupid.

I don't want to make a ""wall of text"" that everyone seems so hate, even though I am so prone to them. I never shut up about myself, do I?

I have some weird issue, where I get depressed late at night. I can be okay all day and then all of a sudden I'm just down and I don't feel like trying to get out.

I have only cut once. But I've had thoughts of it for years and years. Maybe 5 or 6 years. I actually did a year ago. I was so glad it didn't scar... I fear the scars.

I don't know if I'm the only one who is like this but... I love the way it looks. I fear the scars so sometimes I just scratch myself so I see all the little white lines and feel a bit of pain. Or used to put lipstick on my wrist so it looked like cuts (for about 2 or 3 years before I actually cut, I would do this). Sometimes now I use red sharpie. Most of the time I find a razor or knife and just look at it... telling myself, ""just fucking do it."" But then I fear scars and don't. 

I even want to do it when I'm happy. I just like the way it looks! I want to look down and see it... but not the scars, they have to be fresh. I don't want the scars in case this feeling one day passes, or someone sees...

I think about killing myself. I think I'm just sucking the world of it's resources and giving nothing back. I have no job, little friends, and I almost have no where to live. In 15 days if I can't come up with the money, I will be homeless.

I am only living on my own because my mom is crazy too. I had to leave, even though I knew I couldn't afford it. I lost all my jobs over my depression. Everyone can see it. I lost boyfriends and friends, too.

I have a boyfriend now, he broke up with me once over my depression, and that I was still in love with someone else. I tried to prove to him that I was getting better, and now hide my depression better. Fake smiles are becoming easier. He believes in me again.

As for the other that I love... I wish he was just a bit different. Then we would be okay. But he demands sex and lacks any sympathy or empathy. The only reason I'm not homeless today is because he helped me out... but wasn't nice about it. Just gave it to my roommate, didn't talk to me. 

I wish we could've been just friends. At LEAST.
see: crappy and depressing pop song about lost love - Katy Perry

This is getting long isn't it? Just a couple more points...

Back to I Feel Stupid. I pride myself on being smart but I feel belittled by people almost daily. I don't know how to cook. I can't keep a job. I'm a picky eater. I'm shy. OH am I shy. I have some social anxiety. I sit in the corner alone at parties unless I'm drunk/high. I know what they're all thinking, ""What's wrong with her?"" And that makes me even more anti-social. I fear the people.

""Why don't you help me cook?"" ""Why don't you initiate sex?"" ""Why don't you clean something without someone asking you to?"" ""Why don't you know how to do _____?"" ""Why won't you try this food?"" ""Why can't you make a decision?""
I feel like I curl up into a shell when I hear these things. And then it gets worse... ""Why are you all quiet and depressed now?""

I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend but earlier I clicked a Reddit link that turned out to be a ""screamer"" gif. So I screamed. He was resting in bed, like usual, and he yells, ""What the fuck! Fuck you! What was that for?!"" I laughed about it and said sorry, but he didn't laugh. I tried to make light of the situation but he was just angry at me for screaming. Thus started my late night depression. I was just fine before that.

I just don't like when people are mad at me. I just want to make people happy. That's all I want to do with my life.

Okay so:
**TL;DR** - I like cutting but fear scars, I'm crazy shy and it makes people not like me, I think of suicide but fear death, I constantly feel stupid and inadequate and instead of doing something about it, I usually hide in a shell and become worse.

"The whole girls looking for another girl to date but settling for a depressed gamer boy meme is painfully true and it just makes me feel like a second option Every girl I’ve(19m) talked to recently has usually been a bisexual who was mainly looking for a girlfriend but settled for talking with me. One of them even said this themselves. It’s a pretty big meme too and I’ve noticed there’s loads of it on TikTok too

I hate it. Because it literally just makes me feel like another option to people. As if the girls I’ve talked to have only liked me because I’m available and give them attention while they wait for someone better, preferably a girl, to show up."	2
"Just tried to hang myself, fucked up. Now what?26/F
I don't know what to do with myself anymore. No friends, no family, live alone, just lost my SO of 5 years. I have nothing but my career, which locks me out of any 'normal' life. Been on several antidepressants over the past 10yrs, but nothing really helped. I want the isolation and mental anguish to stop. I tried to hang myself but the pain of asphyxiation was more than I could handle sober. I wish I had a quicker way out.

edit: It's Saturday night and I still feel like shit. Nothing's changed. I'll be fasting over the next 48 hours to clear out my gut as much as possible, then take some xanax and try again.

Reoccuring suicide urgesI really thought I was over this part. My studies are on track, my work is on track. I've gotten wiser. I am thankful I didn't jump a year ago. I've found someone who loves me deeply and I love him. But today I got that urge again, while on the train. I don't want to die. But I'm afraid that I can't veer myself back from those thoughts. I picture loved ones dying in disturbing vivid detail and it makes me go mad with tears. Then I picture me jumping and it feels right. I know it isn't. 	1

"LostI've been suicidal my entire life. I'm 27 now, and attempted to end my life back in High school. I told friends/my girlfriend at the time and they helped me through it, I talked to my parents about it and got help. For years I've had things contained, I've learned to live life. Of course there are rough patches but they've never gotten that bad.   


Lately I've been in the deepest, worst, most depressed state I've ever been. I don't know what to do in life, and I feel like everything I've worked on and gained is very rapidly slipping through my fingers. I don't want to be this toxic, awful void in my girlfriends life anymore. I'm so horrible to her sometimes, I don't know how she puts up with it. Deep in my head I hate how I talk to her, I hate how I act, but I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself so much. I don't know how to stop myself from acting so awful.   


I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me. I called one out for behaving insane while he was on amphetamines, and because of that he's manipulated everyone else into no longer wanting me around. By the end of April I will be homeless. My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities. I have no money to my name, and no potential in life. I want the pain to end. I want it all to just go away. I've been told so many times that things get better, when the hell does that start? Am I just a waste of space feeling sorry for themselves? I genuinely hate the person I've become."	1

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

\--------

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide."	1

"TIE THE NOOSEWhen people ask what is the meaning of their life it's because they have one, but stil don't find it.

When I think about the purpose of my existence, I only found the lack of itself. I'm not trying to find money, possessions, luxury, expesive things, nor status; the only thing I try to find is a meaning. But I found out I'm just a useless number.

I only ever cared about the truth, the balance, the understanding, being balanced. But I failed, I failed miserably, while the rest of the ones around me did not, they failed but raised or found another way to keep their living pulse going.

I'm such a fucking loser, such a fucking idiot, such a fucking stupid. The only reason I would kill myself is because of how much disgusting I'm to myself, I can't tolerate such a stupid creature like myself will ever life. Among my surrouding people, which includes my own self, the only one who deserves being murdered is yes, me, fucking disgusting piece of shit.

I still can't understand how people would ever love me. STOP LOVING ME, YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON I KEEP LIVING FOR. I WANT YOU ALL TO SEE THE DISGUSTING PIECE OF SHIT I AM. OPEN YOUR EYES, AND YOU'LL HATE ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS I HATE MYSELF."	1

"not sure what to doi have a somewhat perfect life. i have a girlfriend, 2 good friends, my parents are still together, a house for myself, and food on the table every night. but i can't seem to be happy. ever. and lately i've been thinking about ending it. i just feel so worthless and stupid. especially this time of year. i'm not sure why it's always this time of year but for the past three years during this time i've attempted ""suicide"". no one knows about these ""attempts"" and i've never been hospitalized even though honestly, i think i should've been. and i don't know what i'm capable because of my past. i have no mercy when it comes to hurting myself or suicide. i could end it right now if i really wanted too. and every night i just know it's one day closer to my death. sooner or later.

"I never thought up I'd grow up into such a loserI'm 19, ive had private schooling my whole education. When I started getting into my teens I suddenly got ""secretly sad"". I was really cheerful and funny, kind of like the class clown, but when I got home I used to cut my thighs and cry all night. That faded away when I was in grade 11. Cause I simpler didn't even have time to be sad. My immigrant father was expecting good grades and I had to deliver.  I studied really hard in my last yr to get into uni. Problem is I picked the wrong thing. I picked architecture, I don't even know why I picked it. the only reason is reputation. I wanted my parents to be able to brag. My brother and sister are going to study medicine when they graduate. And me.. I had no idea and when I told my parents that they told me to shutup and get a grip. For fear of disappointment, I picked something that sounded great, and something that I thought would appeal to me,being the creative type. Boy was I wrong. I hated it. The first week I knew this is not what I wanted to do with my life. But I had another class I liked that made me realise I would enjoy a different course. I thought oh hey no biggie, I can just transfer right? ... wrong. I told my parents that I was thinking of transfrrring and they almost fucking killed me. They said I was quitting. That I was lazy. That I was giving up. I said okay fair enough it's only been half a year I'll give it another go. I ended up failing every single one of my classes in my first year. I was so sad I couldn't sleep. I was always afraid to tell my parents about my depression, so I never got help. It was so bad I would get jitters and I would uncontrollably cry. I wanted to cut again but I didn't even have the energy for that. I could t tell them I'd failed because I'd probably be thrown out of the house.  My dad legit said either study architecture or get out of uni. My parents are middle eastern and so they're very strict. Especially my dad. I get that they want the best for me but yeah. It's tough. So at the end of first year I asked if I could transfer again, they said no. I was put on restriction at uni for failing so much. And I could only do it part time. I pretended I was going to uni on days I didn't have it so my parents wouldn't notice.  I failed one class and passed 3, which weren't architecture subjects but were things related to the course I wanted to be in. Now, I'm at the end of my second year in this stupid course. Wasting money each day with something I don't have the talent for. It eats me up inside knowing I have taken someone who is passionate about this fields place. It kills me. I'm so sad I can't even smile anymore. I get yelled at by everyone all the time. My whole family puts me down everyday not only because I don't smile and I'm pretty mean to people now, but also because I'm overweight. Just last week my mother told me I was everything she hates in a person. Sometimes I cry so much my tears don't even come out anymore. I just want to be loved and supported. I have so much pressure on my shoulders and no one understands how bad I want to end it all. I'm a coward. I'm scared of death yet I pray every day for it to come. I feel like I'm dying slowly. I don't know what to do anymore. Can anyone tell me if it's worth it...."	1
I want to dieEveryday I wake up convincing myself not to just end my shit. I was hospitalized for ideation, and diagnosed as bipolar with PTSD. Since then, I had to move to a new state that I have no friends or connections or job in. I have negative money—and even more-so after a hospitalization. My boyfriend broke up with me. I live with my parents which are the biggest triggers that I have. I feel as though I have no purpose and no reason to carry on. I can’t go back to the hospital, I see a therapist weekly and go to a support group. I don’t know what else to do.	1

I'm thinking about suicide.I want to die. I'm a failure, I'm a nuisance and I'm unfunny. I wish I had a purpose to this world. What's the point of my life anymore? I self-harm, I can't do anything right. I'm so lazy and useless. Everybody else would be better off with me dead. I have no skills, I have no friends that would care. I'm a horrible person. What's the point of my existence? I know if somebody reads this, they'll say I'm seeking attention, that I'm being dramatic. This is the reason why I never say anything about my feelings, I keep it all in because nobody wants to hear about my personal problems, nobody would care. I don't know why I'm typing this.. I'm thinking about suicide. I want to die. I can't do well in school either, I'm dumb. My very existence is pointless. I feel like an attention-seeking dumbass. Everybody would be better without me. I'm sorry for sharing my problems/feelings, nobody would care. The only reason I'm still alive is because I'm too scared to take my life.	1
directionless with nobody to talk to.My name is Saomi. I have spent all of my 27 years floating through life with no direction. I have never been someone who had friends, lovers, or an exciting life. I want to live so badly. I want to go out late at night dancing. I want to talk to everyone I see and learn about them. I want to create lifelong friendships. I want to see the world. Lose my virginity. Become an artist. Fall in love with life. However, I know that while these are fun thoughts, I know they are pure fantasy. These things will never happen to someone like me. If I haven't done that stuff by now, I will never be able to shed my shyness, my inhibition, and my lack of action to accomplish a life well lived. Instead of continuing to enable my fantasy life I've decided to kill myself to end the pain and dissatisfaction. Just posting a bit of my swan song here. stay cool everyone.	1
"The AlmostDo you ever feel like almost, since covid 19 started i been strugling i have read storys here that shows that other people than me have it more hard, but still i am tired you know, tired of almost succeding, almost of always loosing to some one else, always being 2nd. Almost having a good life. My life its full of almost you know i just cant do it no more, what would be ironic is that i almost succed too in taki g my own life, i feel like trash, useless, almost a person, almost always the 2nd i am at my limit guys i am sorry i though i could do it but as i write, i took too many blows, no more please, as i write this i am crying tried to talk with mom and all she said was ""dont cry get over it"", my friends ignored me, seems like they really want me off this time i dont wanna die guys but i cant do it no more"	1

"Its frustratingIts frustrating that I don't want to be alive anymore. how i don't really have a reason to live, how im completely fine with dropping dead in an instant but I cant because other people will be sad.  


I don't care anymore, Nothing is appealing to me anymore, i essentially took a year long vacation to find anything remotely close to a hobby, nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do people want me to stay alive? i dont get it. This world sucks, realistically dreams never come true, realistically I'll be working at a dead end job for a company that's irrelevant, probably an hour drive away from the apartment i can barely afford, that pays me bare minimum so that when the weekend finally comes i have 3$ in my wallet to celebrate it.

  
gee, cant wait to do that for the next 30-35 years of my life, and after i retire ill be to old to enjoy anything anyways so really whats the point?

"My life is in danger and nobody fucking knows.I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it through today. I'm at work and feel like I'm about to crash and lose my shit and have a total breakdown in front of everyone. I feel the urge to scream and hide and cry and stab myself all at the same time. I have an appointment with my psychologist set up for tonight, the only person who knows about this, but that feels so far away from right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Suicide is weird. Some days I'm overwhelmed with the need to murder myself, other days I just need it to end and want to die. I never realized before that there is a huge difference between wanting your pain to stop by any means, and wanting to murder yourself. It keeps going back and forth and gets all mixed up, I think I'm losing my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

Even typing this feels like trying to walk through a wall of rushing water. I just need it to end. It has to end. I can't hold on any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote the stuff below when my mind was more sound. Feels relevant.

&amp;nbsp;

NO ONE KNOWS how awful I'm doing because I can't talk about it without risking my relationships/job/etc. So instead I lie and just say I'm sick, the kind of sick that they understand, and sometimes I even start to believe it. I would way rather be sick, sick is simple. People get that sick people can't do everything healthy people can. I hate not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, if I have a migraine, I can just say ""sorry I have a migraine :("" and that's it, no questions asked. Don't get me wrong, I've had lots of migraines, and they are awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but I would still take chronic migraines over this any day.

&amp;nbsp;

If I have a migraine, people don't get mad and confused and expect me to explain further, or think I'm up to something or being passive aggressive or snotty. ""I just can't go. Wish I could, but I have a migraine."" Simple as that.

&amp;nbsp;

People feel compassionate and understand your pain when you have migraines. They bring you food and worry about you and hope you feel better soon. I wish there was something I could say that would incite that level of understanding with people when I'm having a bad day because of mental health reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, at best they get uncomfortable and quiet. More likely they get confused and put off and start to distance themselves from you unless you make it up to them somehow. You owe them if you unload this shit on them.

&amp;nbsp;

It's not fucking fair.

"My sister keeps trying to kill her self and I don’t know what to do.My sister recently had a face surgery that caused her to feel such anguish that she wants to end her life. The surgery was to correct an overbite, however she feels her jaw now looks like a man. She’s also having an identity crisis because she just doesn’t look like her. She can’t stand to look at herself and She covered up every mirror in the house. She has guilt that she spent 19000 CAD on something she hates. She regrets the surgery so much. A reversal surgery is an option, however the soft tissues may never go back, she risks losing feeling in her face and it’s not guaranteed to look like “her” again. It will also cost another 9,000 CAD.  

My sister hasn’t been well most of her life, she’s being trying to commit suicide since she was 12 years old. Before this surgery, she was upset with her boyfriend and before that her job and before that school, etc. She’s 30 now. But this go around it’s become so hopeless. She just doesn’t see a way out of her despair. 

She has attempted suicide several times over her face:
1. Tried to jump off a bridge
2. Tried to drown herself
3. Tried to cut herself
4. Ordered helium online to gas herself
5. Bought a hose to attach to her exhaust and feed in through her car window. 
6. Swallowed 100 pills. All of her medications. This one happened today. 

Every time it’s been a miracle she hasn’t died. Every time we bring her to the hospital she is let out within 24 hours. The longest she stayed was a week. It’s really tearing our family apart as none of us know how to handle any of this. I’m so afraid she’s going to die. I live every day in complete fear that any phone call I get is the one where they tell me she’s gone. I’m doing everything I think I can to make her want to live. I’m struggling with the weight of it. I’m so lost. How can I make the doctors keep her in there for longer than a day? I feel so guilty over this. If I’m doing enough. If I’m doing the right things. The only times I’m not panicking is when she’s in the hospital because I know she’s safe.

Please help me. How do I help her? Why is she always being discharged?"	1

How to improve sibling relationship? my little brother can be infuriating, blatantly doing rude things just to be rude, doing exactly what someone asks him to stop doing, lounging around when the house needs cleaned, being too rough when playing, etc etc etc. The main this is he is very VERY good at pushing buttons and that’s one of the worst things that ticks me off. I really want to improve our sibling relationship and i try to do nice things for him and speak more kindly to him but he just doesn’t want to be nice i guess. he thinks he is a lot nicer than he really is, and thinks that he does most of the work around the house even though he’s gone all day at school(the rest of my siblings are homeschooled). Sorry to ramble so much but does anyone have any tips or ideas on how to get through to him that he’s being such an a-hole?	2

"God loves y'all 
some of you may need to hear this, some of you won't care, some of you will think it's utterly ridiculous. but God loves you, no matter how much you are going through, how much you've done, you're forgiven. Things will be tough sometimes, you gotta remember that if everything was all perfect there wouldn't be a reason for him. ask him what he has planned for you, he may answer, he may not. there is a reason. 

This year i believe is a wake up call. God is always close but he is closer than ever right now. with the tragic things happening every month, there's no way it's just a coincidence..it's almost a punishment for the horrible things humanity has gotten into. you may think he isn't a loving God, but if a judge let a criminal off without punishment, would they be a good judge?  this world is falling apart. he is ready, he's coming soon, try to be prepared."	2

It's the only coping mechanism I have, my ex dumped me after begging me to come back from Oregon cause she missed me.

"I think I just made suicidal gesture?Okay, 

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug."	1

Pretty sure I’ve failed every subject this semester and I didn’t need to. But I can’t help myself I’m self-sabotaging I destroy my life every single fucking time I get it back on track…. Every time.  

Finally got a great bunch of friends is that what you called them? I think more of them are acquaintances. The one friend I thought would have my back when shit got rough didn’t well no surprise there so much for equality. If she has a problem I was always there for her to talk to but when I’m spiralling into a dark place is she ever there for me? No of course not why would she be I’m obviously not worth the time so fuck her and her friendship. I’m your close friend when I need support but if you need it I’m not even going to try and talk to you. Seriously fuck friendships I’m so done. 

So I’ll probably fail this course no surprise I don’t really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isn’t the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother I’d rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off. I’ve always been a coward because there’s always some glimmer of hope but fuck it I don’t care anymore everything I do is pointless. 

I just spent two weeks ignoring the world and now I’ve re-emerged I know every I knew thinks of me differently. They don’t know what it’s like judgemental ass-holes getting everything in life handed to them on a silver platter. 

I just want it to end this life of mine its not worth enduring any longer all is for naught.

"Had enoughAs soon as I think I am doing OK, someone or something will do or say something and I go back to feeling like a piece of shit again.

I need reason to livei have none. every day gets worse. i just want it all to end. i feel like my boyfriend doesn’t love me and i dont have any friends. i constantly feel like a bother, and everyone just tears me down. im done. i just wanna snap and be gone. im so tired of fighting and battling. i hate being alive.	1
"Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt's like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense, almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there's a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly.

**TL;DR** **Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die**

Posting here because I can't act anymore. I can't pretend that everything is okay. I've gained 6kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck, but I also don't care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I'm not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else. 

I think about self harming a lot. I mean, not only suicide but other forms of physical pain. But then I remember I've got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn't change anything.

I don't have a good reason to want to die. There's no major crisis. The relationship breakdown was over 4 months ago and I'm mostly over that. I have enough money for everything I essentially need. Sure, I'll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck, and I'll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk,  but that's not it either. It's not even the fact that I have about three friends, and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February - because,  at the moment.people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with. I don't want anything to do with anyone right now. I can't pretend to not be depressed when I'm around other people anymore. It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work, and I know I don't do a very good job at that as it is. 

It's not really any of that. I just don't care anymore. About any of it. Any of life. I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work 3 days a week. Do look pale and run down as shit though. Going through the motions, I guess, while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about suicide all day, every day. I suspect it's the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post-operative depression, but also the general state of the world. 

Now, I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I'd probably feel better. But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that, because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement. So, I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants. It might be a complete waste of time and money, as it has been in the past, but I can't help hoping that this time will be different, that this time maybe we'll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing.

Also going to see the psychologist on Monday. It's been difficult to get an appointment (a) because it's bloody expensive and (b) because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she's super busy and hard to get into. I'm hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she's the best psychologist I have ever seen. I haven't kept it up because of financial stress, and my mental health has suffered as a result. But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while.

It's been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too. I can't concentrate for more than 2 seconds. I'm agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time. I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not. I can't remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual, and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock. 

I wasn't entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn't want to be on antidepressants again, and I sure as hell didn't want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again. But at the moment it's gotten to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore, so might as well be totally upfront.

I think I'm too lazy to actually kill myself. Having been there and tried that more than once, getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don't have the energy for. Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have, I don't want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with. I'd need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up.

And that's the nub of it. Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures. I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware, that that would be a fate far worse than this. My life could be 100,000x worse than it currently is, no doubt. But knowing that doesn't change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it's way across my brain.

I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty. And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they're not alone."	1
"Im sorryIm sorry, mum and dad, that i am a worthless resource consuming uncompetitive unemployable slob who stays glued to a screen. I have tried, I really want to keep you happy but im unable to. I deserve all the comments you give me.

Im sorry, body, that i abuse you by sitting all day staring at a computer screen damaging my eyes my gut and my brain. I dont have the strength to deal with my conscience and need something to distract me from it

Im sorry, to everyone reading this, that im giving up. I cant live with myself anymore, my problems are too much for me to handle, I cant live knowing i made so many mistakes, I cant live knowing i ruined peoples lives, I cant live knowing people i love and value do not love and value me, I cant live consuming resources without contributing something of value to this world, I cant live when im dead inside. I cant live anymore but you can, you can change everything in your life, you can change. I cannot change things which i want changed but are beyond my control. I know this will seem very stereotypical but as a person who has suffered with the disease of a painful life I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL, I do I really do, but you can make it. So dont give up like i did, you can do it.

Goodbye"	1

"Work pressure and mental tormentHello to all,

I struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my entire college years. I studied medicine in Germany and work as junior cardiologist in a challenging top tier university research hospital here in Germany.

I am getting bullied by my colleagues and mentally tormented. I failed at many research projects and get bullied heavily because of this. I am 26, have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex. The worst part is my work and all my failed projects. I just do not enjoy life. I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations, but I do not want to exist.   
I hate every moment. The only reason why I am living is my family and brother. I do not want them to feel sad when I die.

I just do not want to exist, because I hate life and my existence itself."	1

Feel like i dont wanna go on anymoreI like to do art, music, and all and those keep me alive. But what hurts most is being so down to the point where i couldnt Even do those things anymore. I feel trapped and shit. I know its mostly mental but i feel like shit. I feel unhealthy, even slowly developing shitty habits. I dont eat like I used to and I havent been genuinely happy in such a long time. I wanna quit school for my health but i cant so that adds to my pain. I dont have much peoppe to talk to because i say the same shit over again and no matter how many times i try to get better i keep falling apart. Im just so sick and tired. I have genuine intentions, i have been trying my best to become a better person to at least make people smile but in the end depression is too overwhelming. I feel like i have nothing. I feel like my parents dont understand though i know they want the best for me. Its just crazy. I feel like im going crazy too. Its been a long ride and i really feel like giving up. I know it's a cowardly thing to say to some but im human after all. Maybe my dreams were too great for my situation. Ive had so many traumatizing experiences and nobody i know really relates. It just sucks. I dont know how to keep going anymore	1
"""Suicide is selfish"", ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"". Bullshit.I have heard these for years. It drives me fucking insane. I find it amazing people don't see the blatant hypocrisy.

They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves, and put their family through pain. But somehow, they don't see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don't have to suffer through the loss.

Like really, as if it is isn't enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal, they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all. Unreal. And I'm the selfish one?

Oh, and my other favorite. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Yeah, ok. Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like. There is nothing temporary about it. It is forever. You might get some brief breaks from it, but it's never gone for good. "	1
"I can’t cope anymoreI honestly cannot cope anymore Iv completely given up on life. The desire to kill Myself is unbearable at this point. I just want to get it over with but I’m so scared FUCKKKKKKK!

"The inertia's finally running outI've spent the last 2 or so years suppressing my desire to kill myself, to finally die and not have to deal with any of this shit anymore, and I don't even know why. I don't know why I've kept going until this point, other than the fact that I'm too poor to buy a gun. I dream about it. I fantasize about it. It's the only remaining thing I have to look forward to- my job is a dead end, I'm not going to college, I have no real friends, nothing to make me want to stick around. I'm beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation- my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I'm sick of coasting along just because I can't bring myself to do anything else. I'm unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something, or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery, or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn't waste or some shit like that.  I'm just sick of this. There is not a single aspect of my life that appeals to me in any way any longer, and I'm tired of staying in a world I don't want to be part of just because it's expected of me. I just want to end this, I've dragged it out long enough already. I don't stand to gain anything by continuing in this grain, all that'll happen is I'll just postpone it even longer. 

Hell, I don't even know why I'm bothering to post this, because at the end of the day I'm just gonna force myself to go to work in a few hours like nothing's wrong, then come home to dream about finding a loaded gun again. I don't want to be talked out of it, I don't have any way to do it in the first place. I guess I'm just doing this because this is the kind of thing suicidal people are supposed to do. I genuinely don't care if any of you are interested in trying to talk me out of this, I just feel like saying shit that there's no way I could say under my real name."	1
Anyone else see that reality reddit series post? Lmao was funny asf, but I lowkey wanna see it play out	2
"I don't know how to carry on right nowIm 29, living in the UK.

A small background of my health conditions, just to give some context:
- bipolar disorder type 2
- severe anxiety
- obsessive compulsive disorder (which I'll explain a little)
- emotionally unstable personality disorder
- hyper mobility syndrome
- ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)

My diagnoses mean that I really don't and cannot function normally. I did for so long, forcing everything into a bulging box, taping it shut and hiding it under the bed. 

Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at. Very good at. It was a call centre admittedly, but I really enjoyed it. I made some brilliant friends, including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend. Through him, I have met other friends, plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through.

I ended up having to take a job that sucked. A lot. It was the beginning of the opening of that box. It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed. I was treated like shit. I had no sick pay, so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day, I was financially fucked. I was working full time, looking after my wife and we struggled a lot. Not as bad as some, but my god it was hard. The job was complicated and my MH (which we later worked out was my ADHD) just compounded matters greatly.

I ended up getting another job! HUZZAH! It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job. Private office. Nice little family run business. Annnnnnnnnnnd that's where we hit the snag. I wasn't very good. I wasn't expecting myself to hit the floor running, but I hit the floor. Hard. 

I wasn't worried though, I thought that I would be at least given training. Which I really wasn't. In anyway. But, I soldiered on for four days, getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have, mental health be damned. The pay was so much better, no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home, meaning that no busy town, no social interactions, just iPod and a quiet journey home. 

Then, four days in, the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called. I was on the bus, leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies, as I live in a flat and my wife's mobility isn't great, and this was a iPhone, so I wanted a secure place for it to go. I updated my facebook status ""New job, new me, new beginnings. Let's do this and let's get life back to what it should be! - feeling positive.""

I got on the bus and my phone rang. It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there. The owner wasn't happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn't as good as they expected. Don't bother going back. My heart stopped, and I just didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but realised as a grown man, I had to hold it together on the bus. I started to catastrophise, terrified I was going to lose my house, my bills weren't going to get paid etc etc. Then there was my wife?! What was I supposed to do?

I got home and tried to be pragmatic, I applied for disability, I couldn't cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed. Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope. She had walked off, crushing it in her palm. 

Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit, I ended up in hospital after an attempt, but I was getting better, day by day. I applied for college, am doing ok ish on my course. 

I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD, and HMS shortly after, and I am struggling, but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope. I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife, being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c*nt. 

I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of. If I had my way before, I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a 18 story drop. 

This brings us to now. (sorry if it seems a little patchy, I just wanted to give a little context). My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up, I struggle with even little things not working, just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then. It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything. Many times. It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something. My memory tends to feed the compulsions. I skin pick, I cut at spots, scars, anything that I deem unnecessary. 

This was made very apparent to the disability assessor, when I tried to explain things and just couldn't. I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting. I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding. 

I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment. I am trying so hard, but cannot cope. My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick. It's embarrassing. I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end. 

I have a wife. I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me. I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same. I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this. But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working. 

I don't know what the future will hold.

I don't know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else.

Thanks for reading if you got this far, just writing this down has helped me a teeny tiny bit."	1
“An interesting title” mocks me... How about life is terrible and why do humans put up with it? A Ted Talk by meHow can somedays the thought of taking my own life is swatted away like a annoying fly in my mind and others it’s the only single thought on my mind the entire day? Today was another one of those all encompassing suffocating days. I hate myself so much. I have no friends at all. And no that’s not an exaggeration. I honestly have not one single friend. I haven’t had a real friendship with someone for at least 5 years. The only reason I’m still around is luck and my self imposed responsibility to my family. My gift of looking like the functional college student doesn’t have a single crack on the outside. I’m really very good at pretending and lying to my family and those that talk to me. Well, that’s it for now... Thanks	1

He's made me feel completely worthless and like shit, but I still have to mail him some clothes and shit he gave me and I want to make it a little special just to get some pay back. Anyone know how to make his life just a little more annoying?"	2

"Valar MorghulisWell, I don't even know where to start. I'm not here for you to say me ""Don't do it"", ""We will miss you"" and all that crap. After an extensive analysis of the pros/cons of living I decided to put it an end, as a matter of fact while I write this I'm smoking a ""poisoned cigarette"".

My reasons? I have no future, I fucked up two Careers because I'm just not interested. When I dropped the first one I had the chance to study a new thing in the same university, but I recently screwed that too. I don't know, I'm just lazy, I prefer playing PC games even through I know is wrong, I just can't help it and it's killing me... Basically wasted my parents money and they will be very dissapointed.

I know they love me, I love them and I'm sorry they'll have to suffer my death. But I just can't stand it, here in my country without a degree you'll never win over 400 dollars/month (half the money to survive).

Just wanted to share my story with you guys. Keep helping the people who needs it, you are all awesome.

Farewell.

I hate my lifeI really do but I can’t seem to have the got to end it so I’m just waiting now I wonder when I’m going to die, for some reason I don’t feel like it’s any time soon 	1
"My final goodbyeIt’s come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that I will ever have the life that I’ve been trying to manifest for the last decade and I’m simply not okay with that. I’m no closer to success today than I was 20 years ago and I’m not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. It’s become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. I am so tired of struggling. Always having nothing. I’ve been in debt literally my entire adult life. Even with two bankruptcies I can’t seem to get my shit together. Every time I try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. Constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what I do to try - I’m so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - It’s been literally my entire fucking life. I don’t remember a time that I wasn’t in debt and I don’t remember a time that I haven’t been stressed about finances. It seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that I am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much I want it or how hard I try for it.  
About a year ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening. A realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. I believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before we’re born. The bonds we create on earth are actually created long before we’re ever even conceived. We all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. I’ve had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which I have completely fucked up beyond what I can ever recover from. I’ve done stupid things, said stupid things and I’ve hurt people that I was supposed to walk this life with. It’s unfortunate because I know I could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. I just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. 
Time for a reset. 
Please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me could’ve done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of “I should’ve or could’ve or would’ve” done something had I only known how bad he was. 
I’m so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. I promise that no matter what I will always look out for all of you from the other side. 
I love you 
R ✌️
PS please do NOT have a funeral for me. I don’t want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. Also, I wouldn’t bother dealing with the CRA or the bankruptcy. You’ll only find insurmountably crushing debt that’s pretty much un-erasable anyway... believe me I’ve tried. I’m so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody.

I’m still here. I’m just really sadI think if I tried to attempt, I’d fail again and then I’d feel even worse... if that’s even possible	1
Why cant he be normal? So I (16f) had a crush on this guy (18m). We would flirt and play and shit. Then I gave him head. Then he started not quite ignoring me (we work together) but like not aknowledging me or acting like I'm there. No more jokes or whatnot. Absolutely nothing. And I get it. He was only after one thing. And he got it. But like come on. I get it that you never had feelings. I dont either. But why just completely avoid me? Just fucking be normal for christs sake. Anyone have any clue as to why he's like this? Bc I'm stumped.	2
"Just a huge rantI thought I would share this because I been dealing with this for 3 years and I attempted suicide 6 times but people seriously need to stop it  now I made videos about this on my YouTube channel and videos on my Instagram and snapchat but people wont stop or leave me alone I never sleep from this either but I'm crying for help I'm not attention seeking or even fake and people saying I deserve depression do I deserve it NO I BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FOR 3 YEARS I BEEN TO HOSPITAL I CANT EVEN GET THERAPIST OR ANYTHING MY FAMILY THINKS IM ATTENTION SEEKER AND FAKE TOO I REALLY WANT TO FUCKING DIE ALREADY PLEASE STOP IT IM SOBBING I SHOULD KILL MYSELF AGES AGO IM SUCH A PATHETIC BITCH I have  no purpose here I'm worthless I was mistake  I just wish I was never born...

My friend said they used to have a crush on me It's not really a big deal, they're over it and I prefer platonic relationships, I just am bored and wanted to put something on reddit	2
Hello teenagers of reddit, what advice do you have for me, a dad, to help raise my little people? I could ask other parents but for real, we grow up and kinda forget what it was like growing up you know? My parents never took much of an interest in me besides the necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. Which is a solid start I suppose. What are some things you wish you’re parents would do more often? What are some things you absolutely wish they would just stop right away if they actually listened to you?	2
‪I don’t think there’s anything more depressing than finding yourself on the way to the hospital after a suicide attempt and realizing you don’t even have anyone to tell. ‬Cut too deep, on my way to the hospital to get stitches. Second suicide attempt this month. I’m already at a residential treatment center but clearly it’s not working. Sitting in the car with a staff member I don’t know and realizing I have no one to text to let them know that I’m on my way to the hospital. How depressing is that.	1
"I decided to fight last night and I am currently terrified it wont lastI posted my really long google doc explain my whole situation here and on r/depression yesterday and some of the responses I received resonated with me. I finally sent the document to my gaming clan, who hold me in high regard, after 30 minutes of physical agony trying to press enter. About 20 minutes later it felt amazing, like the wound healing after the bandage was ripped off. I didn't know what was healing, but it was, and any healing is good. As I've been saying, a thousand mile journey starts with a single step, right?

But I'm currently shaking and my heart is racing because I have a strong feeling I'll lose the willpower to live again. My chest hurts just thinking about it, and I cant stop thinking about it. I played a game and had a little bit of fun last night and I dont want to lose that again.
I'm scared to my core right now."	1
"I'm out of options..I've been here before. I've already attempted numerous times. It's just..well..lately, things have gotten back to how they were before I was sent to inpatient, if not worse. I've driven all the friends I had away, my family scorns me behind my back, and I don't have like..anyone I can talk to anymore. 

Is this really the answer? Because for so long, there has been no light at the end of the tunnel. One is approaching rapidly now..but I don't think it's an exit.."	1
Why do I hurt everyone that I love? I’m so stupid I always do something that affects the ones closest to me. I can never have a girl for longer than 2 weeks. Why am I such a fucking cunt. I’m such a rage filled bastard. I try do make the effort but every time I show my true colours and end hurting those closest to me.	2

"I am not well. I was blessed with a NASA internship that I feel I have no right to, a loving family, etc. But I am closer to suicide than I think I’ve been most of my life.I’ve planned twice. 

Those were my lowest points so far. 
But this pit I’m in right now is unfathomable. 

I don’t know how to get out. I am surrounded by smiles but they don’t listen when I say I’m in trouble. 
They say I’m sorry
Or “i hope you find a way around meds to help yourself!” 
Or “you’re so smart and capable! You’ll be fine!” 

But I’m not fine. I feel like I’m screaming in a glass enclosed room and they’re just not seeing me. 
I don’t know what to do, but I feel so, immensely alone. 

The worst part is that I know I have people to reach out to, I’m just not sure if I can handle platitudes anymore. 
I’m tired 
I’m so tired"	1

The thing is my crush has already a girlfriend and even though I tried to tell him that I love him he didn't get the hints!

Right now I don't know of its good to tell him or not? I do know that he is OK with people being gay and stuff.

I should also need him to help me with my depression! I really belive he could help me but I am to afraid to ask! 

So I could use some advice

Sorry to everyone who tried to help me.I wish I could say I've gotten better, but I haven't.  I'm still the same garbage human.  Now I feel even shittier.  I keep saying that I'm gonna do it so I probably should.  Seems like I'm going to run out people who will listen to me if I keep crying wolf.  Goodbye.  I'm sorry. 	1
Can’t escapeCan’t escape this constant fucking disappointment. I disappoint everyone around me. I had all intentions of just letting the drugs take over me. Now the only thing stopping me is actually having people waiting. But that’s almost done and can’t disappoint anyone much longer.	1
"I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this.
  Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely.  However, even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues, the issues themselves remain.  So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this.  I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest (ideals, dreams, goals...etc).  If I am to progress past this low point in my life, I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here.  I am not great with structuring these things sometimes, so please forgive me.

  Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me, the foremost amongst these is my endless source of **self-loathing** and my issues being invested in this world, in this life.  While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades, the knowledge of what I am, everyone is aware that 'it can get worse before it gets better'.  I rode most of these waves rather well, I believe, considering all that has to be unpacked, disposed off and the healing that must occur.  But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me.  

  How can I stop hating myself (if I even should!)?  I have felt this and fed this since middle school, about twenty years ago.  While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact, this is part of the poison that seeps into the well.  I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self-talk and productivity, revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere.  I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools.  But this is DEEP and implacable.

  Next, as with many of us on this path, I managed to **survive by escaping** this world.  For me that meant graphic novels, standard novels, gaming and eventually substances.  Some people think I am strong, but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds, of another life.  Now, even when I try, I struggle to engage with this life.  And by that I mean to really feel invested, to DESIRE to work on something and improve something, to have the hope of any success.  I have always felt like I have been a person that just 'was not there'.  

(Warning for others that are older, harsh thoughts for my age ahead)

All of this is exacerbated by getting older.  Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me.  Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining (without any hope of actually improving really) my body and appearance is just devastating.  I was better of not caring at all.  Who is out there for me?  What is there at all at this point?  Acceptance?  Surrender?  Just making it through and surviving?  Those sound like compensation prizes, like an achievement worth little to no value.  I have focused on goals, ran upon the hedonic treadmill, and behind every thought is...**why?**  My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded, and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value.  And for me, I see none.  

I am weak, I am afraid, and I am a burden to my family and friends.  I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes.  I just want rest, please....I just want to not be me anymore.  I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore.  

Thank you for reading,

Lilith"	1

"Difficult thoughtsSo, I'm in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything. So I guess I'll just post away and hopes it helps a bit.  


So, I had a friend. She commited suicide in 2012, and I got to know only in 2013. I was in my last year of high school when I discovered, and I had a fight with her. Stupid reasons, really. Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn't important. When I tried to talk to her again to apologize, or something, I got the news. It was heartbreaking, and I wish I could have done something, anything. I mean, we were both pretty alone at... life really. And just like that, a person that was one of my only friends was gone, just like that. Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left, that I could never talk to her again. That all I have now is fucking memories.  


So, you'd think, due to my experience, that I'd learn something. I don't know. But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself. I'm not particularly alone, and I KNOW there are people that care. That they are with me, and all that. Still, even when people say that I'm worth it or whatever, I can't seem to believe it. All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing, and how nothing I could ever do would revert that. It's so stupid, but yet, every once in a while, it becomes so heavy and I just don't know what to do. I think that I'm not worth it. That it'd be better if everything came to a stop. But yet, I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care, no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it. Basically, yeah, I don't know. Honestly, I just feel like utter shit, and usually I tank this shit alone, as I've always did. And I see where it takes me. I just wait and see, like the stupid coward I am.  


Anyway, I'm sorry about this. I'm not sure it all made sense, but this is how I'm feeling. this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can't just so something to make it go away. Anyway, I'm sorry if this bothered anyone. I just needed to let this out in a different place, in a place where I don't have the certainty people will just say that I should ""let it go"" already.

"i have nothing left.i tried to improve my life by stopping drinking and benzos. 3 days in I had 2 seizures and spent a few days in the hospital. i fell and fucked my back up pretty bad when I had the second one. I wake up in agony every day. it hurts to walk. i cant afford to go to a doctor

ive  been sober 14 days and my life has gone downhill dramatically. I am being evicted in a few days. I have nowhere to go. My family hates me. They have a huge house but don't want me around. I got out of the hospital with a smile on my face. It's been soooo long since i've been surrounded by nice, smart people. the nurses were great. 




i've been a drunk for 3 years. i haven't worked, i've done nothing. my sister got pregnant and had to move back home, my dads wife left him, we're all broke. my sister doesn't want me around either. i went over there tonight and she called the cops, (second time in a week). they told me to leave or they'd arrest me. on my way out they pulled me over and gave me a $180 ticket for not fully stopping at a stop sign. I can't pay that either.

I try to talk to my dad, he says he doesn't care anymore, he wants to kill himself too. he's facing eviction. he's had it with me and my siblings. My sister encouraged me to kill myself. 

my entire family is against me. I don't have a friend in the world. I don't know what to do.

And yesterday, me and my brother were making our own noodles at the same time so we decided to put them in the microwave together. And I said that 3+3=6 so we should set the timer for 6 minutes because it divides the heat... or something. But he disagreed and said that we should still set the timer for 3 minutes because (of a reason i forgot). So we agreed to set the timer for 6 minutes but take them out when 3 minutes are left. And when 3 minutes were left, I took them out and felt them and they were harder than usual. He felt them and agreed with me and said to put them in for the remaining 3 minutes... but still disagrees with me and thinks that he's right.

Feeling alone and unwantedToday makes the 1 year anniversary of me [19M] moving 1000 miles away from my home to go to my dream college. I moved south because of what my brothers told me, “move away from home, push yourself outside of your comfort zone and you will be amazing with how much you grow”. Well, the only thing that grew on my was a feeling of worthlessness and insecurity. All I see around me are kids my age that are so much more mature or interesting or attractive than me. How do they already have so much more figured out. So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread. Each semester starts the same, I’m so excited to meet new people; to finally get rid of being alone, except I can’t leave my bed I’m so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself. Since coming to college I’ve met people who eventually ghost me and end up just adding to the long list of snapchat stories I watch that only make me sink further into my whole. I’m done here. I can’t even quit and go home, my mother would be so upset. She’s already managing a divorce and counseling of her own, I can’t burden her with this. If I was to die, I don’t think anyone would notice.	1

"Not really suicidal, just depressed...For a while (a couple of years) I have been getting more and more depressed. However, I'm very good at hiding it, so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is. 

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends. But there is one thing that has been missing from my life; a relationship. I'm basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl. I'm 20 now, and it's awkward to admit. I have a girl I kind of like who I work with, but she's from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes.

I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am, but I don't want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist. They have enough worries without worrying about me. I know they would give me all the help in the world, but I just can't bring myself to telling them about it. Every time my Mom randomly asks ""Are you O.K?"", I think for a second to say no and tell her everything. But instead I smile, say ""Of course Mom!"", and move on with my life.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen. It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this."	1

I’m 18 years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more.And I ask myself every bloody day “what’s the point of being here?” I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving.

This isn’t a new question, it’s been haunting me for about 6 years and I don’t know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesn’t help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they’re necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

I’m just taking a random course to begin with so I don’t even know why I’m even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

It’s not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it’s a privilege. But I just can’t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I don’t know how my friends or non-family would take it

I’ve told my parents that I am in fact suicidal 2 weeks ago they took it well, a bit too calmly idk, nothing has changed in our relationship for better or worse

Ps: sorry for the poorly flowing sentences, I haven’t seen my class on how to write a proper suicidal rant"	1
Stupid thoughtsI am struggling to feel like I belong in this world. I am 26 years old, I have a boyfriend who is mentally and sometimes physically abusive. It is easy to say JUST LEAVE, but I have two children, no job and nowhere else to go. I am currently learning a trade, but even when I am at school my classmates seem to cringe at me no matter how friendly I am. **I try to people please and it ends up with people annoyed by my presence. I just want to feel like I belong, or like people want me around.** I feel like if I was no longer here, everything might even be better. My kids have great dads so they would go with them and be well off. I find myself crying at night wondering why nobody, including my own boyfriend of 6 years does not want me around. Now im sitting here thinking of suicide methods, because I feel like I have no place in this world. I feel so lonely. I have had a long life of drug addictive parents, to stripping and prostitution, to trying to better my life. I still have nothing to offer this world. I wish these bad thoughts would just go away.	1
I think I’m falling in love for the first time pretty much ever I dont think that this is a highschool delusion too, I think I’ve legitimately met someone I could spend the rest of my life with. It really sucks that I met her now and not like in college but you never know. Ive known this girl about three weeks now and we have connected so well and talked so much that it’s crazy. But blah blah blah I’m in love, really hope this works out haha.	2
Unpopular opinion : the excited award is so wholesome I mean look at it. Its sweet surprised smile and its tiny hands and its shiny open eyes! I am crying from how cute it is for real i want to give it a hug so bad	2
"Fuck asktransgenderFuck the mods at r/asktransgender I make a post about what I’m struggling with as a trans woman and they just ban and mute me without explanation.  

Well I’ll tell you what - I’m going to blow my brains out tonight in the middle of a major city and I’m going to have their names written on my body so the media can have fun contacting those fucking cunts about what they know about why I blew my head off.

Fuck everyone and fuck all of your stupid fucking privileged lives"	1
Would any of us even be here is suicide wasn’t romanticized?No one has ever lived to tell us what it feels like, if it is truly a solution.	1
I take what people say too seriously sometimes I was told I looked tired yesterday and idk why I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had to pretend I didn’t care but it bothered me. Once I was a leader in a group and I feel like I did a lot of the work. The teacher said that I don’t even do much, he might have been joking but it hurt me so much	2
"Does online s**ual h****sment exist? And if yes...if you didn't specifically oppose to it even though you didn't want it, than it doesn't count does it?

Being alive is traumaticI can’t look at people. Every thought I have is terrible. I can barely form a sentence anymore. I can only eat and sleep to distract myself. I’m definitely ready to die. This is fucking ridiculous.	1
I crave deathI've been doing this for 31 years and I can't anymore. Enough drugs and alcohol and my body will sort itself out. I'm weak and pathetic and tired and I hate myself. I hate being alive when I feel so dead inside. Time to make the exterior match.	1
"The time has come.I personally feel, that the time has finally come for me to take some of my Oxy's, and slit my wrist finally.  I am making plans to write out my ""good byes"" tonight and then get ready for this all to be over. I can't handle this anymore. it is all getting too much. I'm tired of being Tired all the time and not having anything to look forward to in this life."	1
"i have a semi plannot really a plan plan tbh i just want to slightly attempt at this point so i can go to the hospital

idk i just feel like i’m gonna snap soon

i just don’t know if the plan would even work but i can’t comment it here or anything because it’s against the rules and i don’t want to give people ideas"	1

I just lost the woman I lovedMy relationship with this amazing girl ended last night. I loved her and due to having a really really hard past where I have been hurt by parents family friends and women it's hard for me to trust. And I trusted and it's gone. For the first time I've not been happy that I have a girlfriend I was happy I had her. I love her. And it's over and I don't have any close friends. She was my best friend. I feel so alone and so hopeless and for once someone loved that I'm just a dork. For once someone saw something in me. For once I felt like I was actually worth something. For once I trusted. So many women are focused on sex and just don't really care. And she was different. She was everything I've ever wanted and we are over. I have had so much go wrong in my life and so little go right. I just hurt so much	1
"The emotion that comes with everyday life is too muchI've lost so much.

I have so much more to lose.

Its supposed to be normal.

I don't think I can."	1
"I can’t do this anymore.I’m so tired of being the person in trouble. I’m tired of being such a fucking burden to everyone. I really just don’t have the will to go on anymore because no matter what i do, it’s wrong.
The only thing stopping me is lack of resources, but I finally got a blade. So, if y’all never hear from me again, I’m sorry."	1
Anyone want to chat?if you need a friend im here and we can talk as much as you want. My names angel btw and im a guy. I can maybe try and help or maybe we can just chat. Im also depressed but i just want to help the best i can.	1
"Concerned for a friend, our conversation has left me shaken up.I want to start from the beginning, I apologize early on if the information is not needed. I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly. Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird. 


I play online video games quite a lot. This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot. Except for one of my friends who we will call James. We have talked and played together for a little over a year now. This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us. We text/call each other and even video chat on the occasion. James is 19 and lives in another state than I. 


Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts. He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before, but was saved, and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself. 


It all started a about 6 months ago, when he got together with this woman, they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy. He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love. When they broke up he was very depressed, the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated. We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even. Finally, some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again. 


Just 2 weeks ago, he decided to try dating again. He met a girl via a dating app. They talked non stop, which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away. They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great. He was talking about how much he loved her (I don't know if he told her that) and how she could be the one he marries. I didn't want to ruin his fun, as it was nice to see him happy, so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that. 


They broke up yesterday. He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn't get the text for another hours. All it said was ""I need someone right now"". I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened. I gave him a call, no answer. I text him, no answer, so I called him again and he answered, saying he was at a friends getting drunk. I asked if he was okay, and he explained to me what happened. They broke up because ""her mom told her she didn't want them to be together"". He pretty much hung up on me, so I decided to give him space, as he clearly didn't want to talk about it. 


Today, when I asked him if he wanted to play any games (I didn't want to bug him about what happened). He said he would, so we got on and played for about 20 minutes before he left to go play a different game. After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated. He asked to play, so I hopped on the game and joined him. I asked him if he was drunk, he said he was. I could tell. 


This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much, he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday. He was slurring his speech, making incoherent sentences, etc. Then he (very casually) says he wants to ""blow his brains out"". It took me by surprise and I asked him why. He says he was in pain, saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore. I got more and more concerned as he spoke. I had no idea what to say. I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that, so I asked him if he was serious, why he was going to do it. He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn't deserve to live anymore. 


I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him, his family and friends would, etc. Anything I could think of to say to him. He just shot everything down, saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends (including me) could ""fuck off and go to hell"" because he will be dead and won't have to deal with the consequences of his death. I pretty much was left crying my eyes out, left not knowing what to say. All I could say was ""your life matters to me, and I would be upset if you died"". After repeatedly saying he didn't care, he finally says ""do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you? No i wouldn't be"". 


He basically started to lash out against me, and I had nothing left to say. He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say. Right now, I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk. He didn't respond and just logged off of the game. Hasn't answered my texts or calls. It's not my fault I have to go to work and can't listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night. But I did offer to listen while I was at work. 


I honestly have no idea what to do anymore. I'm not sure how serious his threats were, and I have no idea where he lives, no contact other than his cell phone number. I don't know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage. "	1

First time posting...I'm not even mad, or sad, or happy anymore. Just feel......bored? Filled with dread thinking of living a full life. I have nothing to contribute anymore. Burned so many bridges because of my mental health struggles. Now I'm a SAHM and I love my kids but can't help but think my issues will only hurt them. Seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and started new meds. I dunno, just thought I'd reach out? 	1

"Bye To Anyone That Even Cares To Take Their Time And Read ThisI know this seems cliché, but I honestly feel better off dead. I realize I'm not the only one who has had a shitty life, but it's about time I think about what I want. I can't even describe, or begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the trauma and violence I've had to put up in the past and my current status is no better. Maybe not as violent? But the memories are still there and my life was ruined way before making this thread. I had a dream before making this thread. I would like to share with each individual's undivided attention. As I said before I've been through a lot of trauma. I have been through heart aches, violence, plenty lives have fell victim in my life and resulted into me watching death do it's part. I even was one of those victims or could've been after attempting my very 1st suicide and it resulted in me being pronounced dead for 5 minutes and that's being aided by medical personnel. I'm no war veteran or anything. I simply had possibly the worse luck in this game we play called life and it's like playing chess except I was the pawn, but that's just it? I was stuck being the pawn no matter how hard I tried to do the absolute necessary to change my life for the better and it failed miserably over and over and keep in mind? I was doing this all myself. I never had a shoulder to lean on or someone to be my side and say ""I love you and everything will be alright"". I don't have anyone to talk to and no one thinks I'm worthy enough of their time and never take me serious. Anyways sorry for going off topic, but this dream I had was a beautiful thing. At least in my eyes. That I was laying terminally ill in my bed in a dark room with a light shining down on me. Keep in mind I am not terminally ill, nor am I mocking those that are. In fact if you want my opinion? I rather take every disease someone has and pass it down to me because there are good people in this world that don't deserve to lose their lives. I know what to expect now. Someone will say "" well neither do you"" or ""what makes you so different from the rest of us""? Well forgive me for the only thing I can feel is my own suffering and hurting and not someone else's so of course I'm going to feel like I'm the only one at this moment with nothing to lose in which I don't and with the most pain. Life will be better without me and some will not understand me? And some might and even if you do show care? It's not genuine. Anyways I am sitting here playing with a loaded firearm I recently ripped off and stole. I know some will say "" we can't stop you "" nor do I expect anyone to, but you can say your worse to me and it has got to the point where if I were to recover from this? I'll just use all the hurtful things said to me as left over motivation to lead me back in the position I am right now. Take care to all of you and thank you for letting me say my final peace. "	1
EVERYONE STOP WHAT HAVE I DONE	2
"i have no reason to be alivei'm going to rant here, as to not bother or burden my friends and family, i'm not worth wasting their time lol. thankful for places like this. 

but anyway, the more i think about it, the more i realize i actually have no reason to be alive. i wanna die, i hurt myself, i feel depressed and anxious all the time, i get in the way, i have no clear talents...i could go on and on about it. but it truly feels like as time i goes on, i find less reasons to live. i wish it were the opposite, but it isn't. 

and i feel fucking selfish, because my family provides me with everything i need, and i feel so ungrateful. and that's another reason dying would be good, they wouldn't have to spend money on me, or waste their valuable time on me, or worry about me anymore. 

but anyway, how are you all? if anybody wants to talk, i'm all ears. feeling like this sucks. so, if anybody wants somebody they don't know to talk to, i'm all ears"	1
"I hate how people's life's suck so wanna hear an embarrassing story to maybe cheer you up? Right so I was listening to my little pony songs and having a yt reccomendations nostalgia trip and I remembered a really embarrassing thing about me.
So when I was like 8 my school was doing a talent show and nobody in my class volunteered so my teacher made my friend do it and she got me and another friend to do it. We chose to sing under our spell from the mlp rainbow rocks movie (btw them girls watching them back have a weird tension about them), I was originally a backup singer but main girl couldn't handle the role so I took it and I sung my little heart out and we got to the finals but we lost to someone singing a Bruno mars song or something idk. I was sad we lost because I was 8 and I really just sung in front of hella people only to loose. ( didn't matter to me because the prize was a tennis racket and a ball from Poundland) oh well, now I've remembered this I have a massive flex on people because I went and did that. What a power move. 8 year old me was a mythic person 10/10 would do again. Tl;dr, Sung mlp song at school talent show, gigachad move, didn't win."	2
I'm so tired of livingI just want some to fucking listen, first off sorry if my grammer sucks because I'm not really concerned about that right now.....anyways. I'm so fucking tired of everyone, I want someone to really listen and understand how hurting I really am everyday, sure maybe it's not the worst every single day but it doesn't take a scientist to understand that somethings wrong with me. I'm always struggling and it feels like it'll never end, how will I ever become the person I wanna be when I don't even know what that looks like. I am hopeless, a disappointment and a failure. I try to open up to people I know, only person I'm really open with is my girlfriend but she doesn't understand how hurt I am, I love her so much. She's my only friend and only person who doesn't dismiss me, but we've fought so much lately, I thought we were past all this but it's come back. I simply just wanna die, it's like I've been in this situation far to much this year. Too be honest I'm to much of a coward, hell even my girlfriend said that I'm a coward for not being open with my parents about how I struggle. There's a lot a struggle with but it'd take forever to do it all. I just want someone to understand, I'm sorry this is vague but I'm not sure how to write all of this. Fuck me, I wish I was never born. 	1
"I did everything I was told to do. For years. It doesn't workAnyone who looks at my post history can probably tell this is a venting account, and as people can see,I have been like this for a very long time. Ever since I stopped being a Christian back in the mid 2010s

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets ""UHM ACKTUALLY"" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

I am just here for no reason and I hate it. It isn't fun. It's scary and I just want to stop getting out of bed anymore. I just get up because I don't know what else to do. I want to jump off a building already.

I don't have much more to say. I'm sorry. This is so dumb. Everyone says to find a purpose. But that doesn't matter when rape, viruses, and murder surround us. Everyone alive now is gonna die in 100 years anyways"	1

I hope all of you have a very nice day tomorrow and that someone else does something nice for you to make your day brighter That extends to everyone, not just the people who read this post. But if you did read this post, try to be that person that makes someone's day a little better tomorrow. Talk to someone about their interests, invite a friend to hang out somewhere, talk to someone who seems lonely, compliment someone. Even the smallest acts of kindness can make someone's day, so make it a goal to make someone's day tomorrow. It doesn't matter how you are feeling because when you make someone else's day better, it'll also make yours better since you'll know you at least tried to make a difference.	2

"my life has become a nightmareTnis will be a long read but I'm very grateful for those who will read it. I'm going to start this off by saying I've never been a happy person. I've always seeked solace in philosophy &amp; drugs. I've done numerous drugs to try and help me. LSD, shrooms, tons of benzos &amp; opiates, MDMA, but they always only help temporarily. I've been depressed. Always. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I can't remember the way I was before it ever came into my life. But life somehow started looking up for me, I had a well paying job, drugs, close friends, a girlfriend, a car, and just my freedom. I had everything I've ever wanted in life. I wasn't happy but I was content and had a hope for my future.

Until two weeks ago where I made the worst decison of my life ; that was driving when I was fucked up. I was coming home from a day filled with popping pills and smoking with friends, &amp; I made the most selfish, stupid decision of driving under various substances. I swerved and my wheel came off the road, lost traction and pummeled me into a pickup truck. I was on the highway going 60. My car got totalled. Ambulance had to bust the windows in the back because my car flipped to get me out.I was fine besides hurting my neck and some major bruises. But I admitted in the emergency room that I was messed up &amp; under various drugs. I got arrested and charged for wreckless driving, DUI, &amp; plenty of drug charges they found in my car after. I'm failing all my classes. I've always had a great GPA, a really good ACT score to get me into a decent college with a nice scholarship but ive ruined that future. Besides losing my future, friends, job, car, money, freedom, &amp; my reputation. I put two other people in the hospital. 

One of them is a father. Has kids. &amp; He's been in the hospital since. He has a broken neck &amp; in a lot of pain. I couldn't imagine what I would do to some fucker who almost killed my mom because of their dumbass decisions. Ive been living with the guilt since. That I almost killed another person, almost made some kids live without their father. I'm the lowest person and I honestly feel like I don't deserve to live. I wish I never wore my searbelt, that I was killed in the crash. I truly deserve it. Insurance isn't going to cover any medical bills. I put myself and my mom in thousands of dollars in debt. We cant afford that. She works as a single mother, supporting three kids as a fast food manager. Besides contemplating suicide daily because of living with this guilt amd regret that eats me up 24/7. Ive lost everything. I've become a disgrace to my family, to society. My brother tells me daily how I should've died &amp; how much of a piece of shit I am. My dad was a drug addict who left our family at the age of 6, and my mom &amp; brother tell me how I'm far worse than him. It hurts so fucking much. All of this does. I can't bear this emotional pain. I never meant to hurt anyone in my entire life. Ive always been so nice and caring to others because I know life is hard &amp; I only wish to bring good to others. But I've fucked my life up beyond repair.  

I don't see a way out of this. I don't want one. I just wish I had the fucking balls to end this guilt and misery I feel ALL the fucking time. I can't keep living. I don't deserve to. The only person who has a little faith in me is my girlfriend. I love this girl to death. She's the most amazing person I've ever met. Shes the only one who has faith in me &amp; support me. But I can't even see her with no car. I don't have a phone to talk to her. I'm probably going to lose her too. I hate that I'm making people suffer because of my decisons. These poor people I almost killed, my family, my girlfriend, my friends. I've truly lost everything. I hope so much that I just can end it all. To stop feeling this misery. To never have to see another day. Hopefully one day I will. Thank you for reading."	1

"Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last 3 years. It started pretty weak, I thought about suicide once in a month, but then it became worse and worse. I already had 4 real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation. Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than 4. 

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep. Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep - knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end. It make me feel calm. I know this is sick. I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself. 

P.S. Yes, I recovered by depression with meds and therapist. You can see that this didn't help. Mental health care is very poor in my country. So no one will help me. I don't even know why I write it here, just some kind of venting. "	1
"I thought I was ready to kill myselfI had a hot bath, I cut my left wrist and was planning to just bleed out, i thought it was pretty aesthetic how the water started to look, and how the blood was flowing from my wrists. I started to feel scared, very scared. I'm an atheist, and I accept that there is nothing after we die, but coming so close to it made me scared. Or maybe I'm just a pussy, or going out hannah baker style isn't how I want to go.

I think i'll make a bucket list before I die. There's a few things I want to do before I die. I've never eaten a steak before, I think I'll try that. I did check off one thing from my bucket list today now that I think about it. I think I'll revisit some old memories from when I was a kid, the area isn't far from me. 

I'm good looking, funny, confident, great hair, great voice, i have women, i have money, but I'm not happy. My entire personality feels empty, I just emulate whatever character I've seen before, for whatever suits the situation. I don't really feel like a person. When i'm not trying to emulate anyone, all I really am is just angry, edgy, unfunny, blunt, and above all just stubborn. My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering, my suffering has always been my own fault.

I realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother, growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer. I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier. Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional. I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me, it will always hurt, and I just can't seem to forget. 

My wrists really hurt, i'm in no danger of dying anymore, I'm just dizzy and want water. Maybe I don't even want to die, if i truly dead I wouldn't be alive right now. Or perhaps its the natural instinct to survive that's restricting me?"	1

"I fell in love with a married woman.I fell in love with my best friend, who happens to be a married woman. Not ling after she says she fell in love with me too. For 10 months we were ""together"" trying to figure out how for her to leave her bad marriage. She told me all the time how horrible her husband is and how she wanted to live life with me. She came clean about a month ago to her husband, telling him about me. He guilted her into staying. Saying she disobeyed God and him and now she owes it to him to stay. Well she continued to tell me she believes God will let her leave someday. I found out tonight her husband told her to leave. Literally got a suitcase and put it in front of her, only for her to decide to stay. She has also gone back to sleeping with him. But in the emails she was telling me these things she was also saying how she continues to pray everyday for God to bring us together. I don't know what to do. Her husband threatened to put a restraining order on me. I feel so guilty and also at the same time so hurt by the constant back and forth ""I believe we will be together, I need to stay."" It's driving me insane and I don't know what to believe anymore. The constant pain is unbearable."	1

"It just hurts.Im a married guy in his late thirtys. I just want to be normal and have kids but i never will. I got dignosed in my early 20s as having borderline personality disorder. Bpd effects people in different ways. For me it makes me feel like knowone wants or cares about me. All the time. For me this is a huge deal. I need to be loved and wanted or there is no point being alive. I feel like a massive burden to my wife and family. Im deeply ashamed that i havent succeded in life like my brother and sister. I work hard but i never seem to get anywere because as soon as i get an opportunity i self sabotage because i refuse to let myself be happy. I think my wife who i love with all my heart has had it with me. 

No one seems to care. I get told to shut up. I get told im making people uncomfortable. I plan on killing myself before christmas. I just hate myself so much i cant contain it. I just want to die a really painfull harsh death so that i can be punished for the disharmony i have created on this earth.

I only seem to be able to remember the negitive things that happen to me. People always seem to use then discard me. My mother died when i was 17 and i never remotely got over it. Its still as raw as when it happened. All i can do is try not to think about her.

I dont want to go on living in misery. Im only here still here because even though i feel ive ruined my wifes life she is the reason im  still here.

I stood on a highway overpass on my lunch break and tryed really hard to get the courage to jump but i was just to scared and i guess i knew the drop wasnt enough.

Noone cares. They tell me to ""man up"" or to think ""positive"". I cant feel or understand how they care when all they do is reject me and push me away. Meds dont work. Therapy dont work. 

I just dont know how the fuck to go on. Why should i be expected not to kill myself when i view the world like this?"	1
"dont mind me, just gotta vent for a minute even though im a happily quarantined introvert attending online school, 2020 has still been rough, as it has for everyone. i seriously think this year is cursed. ive been insecure, lonely, depressed, and constantly anxious for years now, although its all been going quickly downhill recently. despite how happy i was to be free from attending irl school, i found myself missing the little social connection/affection that i was getting. that emptiness and longing has been growing faster and faster; i cant stop thinking about having a loving relationship, and every time it pops in my head, it eventually leads to thoughts of inadequacy because i feel like i'll never have one. i cant stop judging myself for how fucking ugly i am - i wish i could just accept it and move on, but its always in the back of my mind gnawing at me. i dont have any real-life friends, ive been fighting with my parents more than ever, and the only person i really trust anymore is my half sister (my only sibling) - but shes 25 and always busy with her own life, so i hardly ever get to speak to her. on top of all this, my mom is a therapist, so i'd feel really guilty asking to see a different one - if i asked, it would probably just lead to a painstaking argument that would leave me in tears again. my mind is in a near-constant state of turmoil, and the only way to cope is to jump from obsession to obsession in order to run away from my thoughts. i have no skills/talents and nothing seems to make me as happy as it used to. i cant stop noticing flaws with myself, i always blame myself for everything, and i cant get rid of this \*\*stupid fucking desire for cuddles.\*\* ive always had trouble expressing myself/articulating my thoughts (which i believe to be a symptom of high-functioning autism, but my mom refuses to get me tested), so i have trouble opening up to people even when i want to. as a result of all of this, i feel like im caving in on myself, and i just dont know how much longer i can last.

"I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff, have been unemployed for 1.5 years so I will be choosing between suicide and ??? very soon. Open to unusual suggestions.**Just read the bold text as a TL/DR if you want.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree - German - that I deeply regret in December 2014. The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues. I have a little OCD, some Borderline Personality Disorder traits, and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II. I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either. I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis. **I have spent 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated unemployed.** It took me a year to find a job. I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly. That happened just eight months after I had left my parents' house. I didn't even make it a year on my own. That was a year and a half ago. I cannot find a fucking job. I have tried everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree. Over the past month, for example, I have applied to 185 jobs and only made it to a 2nd round in-person interview 4 times. So here we are...* 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm ready to die. I have a note and a plan.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from. On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes, he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met. My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them. We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past. **There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the 4 people who are part of my life behind.** I have read enough of r/SuicideBereavement to know what it'd do to them and I don't care most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **My suicide method of choice is irreversible. Guaranteed to kill me.** This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn't take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn't high enough. I will be gone. Thus, I must be very certain about having no other options left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you'll say ""why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents?"" *That is not something I can accept*. I didn't push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this.** This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now, there is no way I could work at Macy's or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either.** I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed. I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds. Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems. I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I don't know what the fuck I can do. Here are the things that occur to me at this point, in order from most reasonable to least:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a ""temp to permanent"" role that actually pans out. The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house, even if it is full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful. That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living. It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway. I have a car that is worth around $10,000 that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept my suicide as inevitable - living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible - and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else. $10k gets you a long way in a third world country. You may laugh at this but I'm actually kind serious about this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kill myself. Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it. That's it. This miserable existence I never asked for would be over. I have had sex, fallen in love, been to Europe, enjoyed meaningful friendships, done psychedelics. Its been nice. But I can't take this shit anymore at the same time. Every day is the same. Sitting at this fucking desk. Miserable. Insane. Lonely. Hopeless. I think about suicide constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"	1
How do u become a mod here? I have no idea, just interested in what the whole process is	2
Bye guys.I'm just here to say, that suicide is definitely the right option for some people. Don't let people who don't understand your own personal situation otherwise. I'm not saying that it's a good thing to do, but for some, like me, it's definitely the best choice. Bye bye.	1
"I fucking hate my familyI hate the fact that my parents were super strict in raising me and breathe down my neck constantly. As if it isn't embarrassing enough being 24 years old, living with my family, still haven't finished college, and don't have a license. My mother worries about EVERY.LITTLE.THING. and it has caused me to have severe anxiety and I cannot complete simple tasks without having a panic attack. I struggle to have any kind of relationship to the point where I just gave up doing that so I just focus on school and working while I spend all my free time on my phone wasting away.I fucking hate that they brought me into this world full of suffering where I cannot be taken seriously by anyone and will always be inferior compared to someone else. I don't want therapy, I don't want drugs, I am sick and fucking terrified of the half-assed condescending bullshit phrases that people say like: ""It gets better"". No it fucking doesn't and it never will so what is the point? If you are not fully equipped mentally to have children, do society a favor and don't fucking breed. "	1

"8 reasons i don't want to livewhen i consider the option of death, i usually think of the following problems:
1. i have depression.
2. i have an eating disorder. i was somewhat fat, then lost some weight but now can't eat normally, usually overeat.
3. because of 2. my boobs are not that firm anymore, not sure if they're even beautiful.
4. this summer i will have to pass exams in order to enter the university, but all this uni stuff, grades, papers is stressing me out.
5. i have bad vision (-3.5 both eyes). and i am afraid it might get worse.

"Never thought I'd be having suicidal thoughts.I don't really care that this is my main account.

I'm currently camping with my four best friends in the world. We planned this trip for ages and now it's actually happening, but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone. Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die. One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn't revolve around me, which is of course right. I shouldn't be controlling them, it's just the anxiety talking.

I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three, when we decided to go to bed. However, despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset. I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely, to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it. You can't just forget anxiety issues, they're always there.

I cried myself to sleep, then woke early this morning shaking. Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them, so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar. I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake, so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me. She said she'd been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick. I was finally happy - he actually cared.

When we got back to the tent, he was asleep. I don't know about you but when I'm worried sick about someone I don't fall asleep until they're found. I left again. I'm now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out. I'm always there for them, but I never feel like they care for me at all. I'm entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life - maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they'd finally care about me? I'm tempted to make myself throw up right now so they might actually take me seriously. I'm a disgrace, and everyone's fed up with me. At least if I killed myself they'd actually care."	1
Please help my friendI don’t know what to do. He kept talking about how it is so difficult for him and that no one cares about him. I tried to listen, and state that there are a lot of people who care about him but I don’t know if it’s working. He said to not be surprised if he doesn’t respond. Please.	1
sometimes my friend is chaotic good, sometimes just chaotic His neighbours and antimaskers and wont let others around the neighbourhood wear masks. My friend knows his mom would die if she got covid.

He also burned down an abandoned house	2
"Is this actually DBT, or is this just bad therapy for depression?My therapist's response to ""I wish I could die without affecting anyone else,"" was ""Well that's impossible. Of course people who love you would miss you. I would miss you. It would be devastating!""   That seems little short of guilt tripping.  I won't say it's totally ineffective, but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist.  Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention? Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world.  Like, Sorry, you're ok and all, but you're just my therapist. I don't even know you.  Self harm has been officially unamed ""unacceptable,"" and is punnishable by 24 hours of no contact/no phone coaching.  Phone coaching, the thing they're supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying (again) to kill yourself... If somebody's so desperate they're self-harming, possibly with intent to kill.  You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost.  For the love of god, why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything, and if they get it for being ""good"" (presenting as asymptomatic) and not for being ""bad"" (symptomatic), they'll stop self harming or attempting suicide (being symptomatic)?   You cannot just *manipulate* me out of being suicidal.  That's not how this works.  I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly... heavy-duty, or industrial strength or whatever.  Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people.  That's what I came for, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm getting.  It assumes people are illogical attention-motivated children above all else.   While I'm not some mastermind genius, I find that pretty insulting.  What, do I get a gold star for each day without self-harm, too?  I know! Let's go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy.  /s  I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, and this shit does not jive with what I've been taught to expect of DBT.  I'm disappointed, really.  Flat out salty.  That and it's full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out.  My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it's a proper noun or something. Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence.  I don't like mindfulness, I actually kind of hate it, and the deep breathing bullshit too.  It doesn't work.   I don't like this toolkit, I don't like this therapy, and I hate this life. --Treatment resistant depressive. Nothing works. Not even a little."	1
I fail at lifeYeah. That's it. I mean, I've got some legit issues. PTSD, anxiety disorder. I'm on meds. I'm in therapy. But I have my kids' stepmom telling them that she's their real mom and that they should tell me not to come to school activities because she's coming instead...I make a fool of myself in front of people on a regular basis because apparently I have no capacity for interacting with others...my fiance thinks I'm an incompetent idiot...I can't leave because of my kids, right? that's what they say. But they're already being brainwashed into thinking I'm not as important as their stepmom. I'm trying to assemble the suicide bag thingy and I can't figure out the valve...I fail at this, too. 	1

"Let me explain to you why suicide is the best thing ever for ANYBODYSuicide is awesome. Because suicide by definition is the intentional taking of own's life. You take your own life. Your actions do it. Nature doesn't kill you, you don't die just randomly, no you fucking do it. Isn't that awesome? I think it is...because death is fucking great, and your own actions cause it. I love death. And today death is going to become reality for me. I'm really depressed and i have anxiety, but i haven't told anyone. Because i just don't see the point in it really. What good would that do me? I get help...and i kill myself some other time. Because that's just the way my brain is. So fuck it Reddit. Let's go out with a bang shall we. I had this eternal struggle for a very long time and i made up my mind. And i'm happy because it's going to be over soon Reddit. But Reddit i need to ask you something first. Do you want to watch it? My suicide. Because if you do, then yeah i can livestream it. I don't care. I know some people find it fucked up and not cool, but a lot of people want to see it right? So i'm down Reddit...i'm down

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to kill myself in a isolated place so i don't know when people will find my body, if ever even. That's the way i prefer. I don't want to hurt people that are close to me. Okay that sounded wrong, i know i'm going to hurt them if i disappear but it's not going to much of a mind fuck like a suicide would be. At least that's what i think. Anyway Reddit if you want to see it, tell me and i'll make a post before i go live okay?"	1
"I want to die honorableI don't know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious. While I know I would never harm myself willingly, I yet desire to cease existing.   
But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle. I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave.  
And in case I don't die from that then great. But I doubt it because I am not good. I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden. And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age. So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don't regret having to go there. But yet perhaps that would make it up for this. I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway, right? So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup.   
Because else I am just a burden and non-loved by anyone. I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well. I am the kind of person that depends on others. I have to push myself and if I can't go on I just feel horrible.  
For years I have tried following my dreams, actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed. Sure I tried and did my best, there is nothing more I can do. But this is exactly what bothers me. If my best isn't enough to continue, what else can I do? You don't wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible...  
And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands. Be it job and career or love life.   
Sure I have friends and family, I have a roof over my head and food on the plate.   
But life is more than just surviving, especially in these times where society expects much more of someone.  
I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now. But the more days pass, the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die.  
Today it pushed me on the edge, I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years. To think I really be pushed that hard...  
But I don't know why for some reason I still do have hope. I kinda always have hope for something. I cannot explain this phenomenon. Even if I think I plan to die in battle, I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively. Even in such negativity, I find positivity. But this all is a double-edged sword. the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other, the side that just wants me to die.  
Does anyone else feel like this? Can you understand this?  
And yes I am already trying to get help but I will not know the outcome in the end of all this"	1

"What's the point in life when you've never had anyone to share it with?I'm lonely. I have no friends, no family and no girlfriend. I've never had friends, family or a girlfriend. I've always been alone. All I've ever had is coworkers, fellow students and care givers. I fear that since I missed out on all of that that I will never have anyone in my life. I don't know what the issue is but I seem to lack the social skills to find someone. I keep getting close but it never works out. There is always something that happens and usually it's beyond my comprehension that just causes everything to end abruptly. I hate volunteering, I hate working, I hate waking up everyday. I just want to die now. I don't see things ever being any different. The only people that do show up in my life want something. I don't care about me. All they do is tell me all about themselves and when I reciprocate with about me they tune me out. This is a horrible world. It's never been fun. I've never been happy. Everywhere I've ever went I've been alone doing it. It's always sucked. I don't even want anything other than just someone to share my life with. I can't wake up tomorrow alone again. I don't want to be in this world anymore.

"Here's what's going on in Texas for those who don't know There was a big snowstorm a couple days ago. Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

"I feel ugly, and it makes me feel like I have less value as a person.I deal with body dysmorphia. Not that the things I see don't exist, but I realize that I obsess over my appearance more than most people do.

I find myself hideous. My face slants. It's fucked up that I couldn't just have a normal face. Doesn't have to be gorgeous. But I mean, my whole fucking face slants to the side. Logically, I know that people probably don't care. But I constantly think about when I am talking to people. I see it. I obsess over plastic surgery. I obsess over ways to make it less noticeable. It's going to cost around $20-30,000 if I want to fix it. Part of the problem is I have a cross under bite. So it makes my jaw slant to the left. But then I have a droopy eye. Which looks more apparent because of the slanted jaw. If I want to get the eye fixed that's around $3-5000. Even my fucking ears are slanted. My face looks like I had bell's palsy, but without the complete loss of muscle movement in the side of my face. 

These things aren't in my head. I wish I had full on body dysmorphia where I just see things that aren't real. I've posted on /r/rateme and people have pointed out exactly the things I see. When I was a kid and got my ears pierced at the mall, they said they normally would pierce one ear a little higher and the other a little lower to make them look symmetrical. However, my ears are so crooked that they couldn't even do that. You can't even surgically fix crooked ears.  Today I went and got botox, and the lady recommended that I get microblading for my eyebrows because it would make my eye look less droopy. Which of course I'm going to do (but not with her), because if I can make myself look less crooked for a couple hundred bucks then yes I'm going to do it. Beats the several thousand. 


My family thinks I'm vain. Which I guess I am. But you know, that's pretty freaking easy for them to say. Somehow I was the only one born with a half smashed face. I'm the ugly duckling. But I'm superficial because I want to get work done to make myself look normal. 

I understand that I'm being shallow. Of course people still will talk to me even if I'm ugly. I'm great at making friends. But you know what I'm not good at? Getting guys I love to stay. They move on to much prettier girls. I'm the girl they date while they have low self-esteem. I have a nice body. I'm the girl they want to hit and quit. You bang the body, but you marry for the face. 

I just don't think I'll be at peace in my head until I get the surgeries done. But I can't afford them. Sure, you'll probably tell me that it won't make me happy. I call bull shit. When I was younger, I had an eating disorder. I hated my body. I hated my thighs and wanted that coveted thigh gap. Now, years later, I work out, and like I said, I have a good body with curves. But I also now have that coveted thigh gap. And you know what? I fucking love it. It makes me feel good that I can stand with my feet together and my thighs don't touch. Dumb that I put so much value on it? Yeah, probably. But it rings true that if I fixed my other physical flaws that it would make me feel better too."	1
"How do you guys feel about going on dates without knowing if you wish to start a relationship?

"My mom “cant take it anymore”. Neither can I.I’ve been depressed and anxious for most of my life. My parents haven’t helped. They listened in the first little while when things got really bad but now I’m just annoying to them. I’ve been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (I’m talking fucking years dude) and I’m experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with. Electrical cord is a noose. Could drop a hair dryer into my bathtub. Slit my wrists with the xacto set I bought to try and feel better and make something instead of doing nothing. I can’t hold down a job, I’m living at home, isolated. I have a boyfriend but he just isn’t helping. The feeling, the itch to kill my self is too strong. I keep trying to get him to leave the house so I can just do it. I’m terrified of death but between the depression and chronic physical pain due to it and the isolation, I can’t feel anything. I’m either numb or crying and this has been going on for weeks. I’m back to forgetting what even a fleeting moment of happiness is. And to top it off, the only thing I’ve been looking forward to for months, the only thing I’ve been trying to live for I can’t go to anymore. I’m a failure and I have nothing and not even my dog likes me. I’m better off dead. 

A few days ago I was just lying on the floor in the garage. I’d been trying to build something to keep busy but the materials my dad said we had weren’t right and I just spiralled. I laid on the concrete floor and when my mom came in the first thing she said was that she couldn’t take it anymore. It being me being suicidal and depressed. She wanted to send me to a hospital (despite the last time me going, I got misdiagnosed and put on Effexor which made my life an unlivable hell) instead of just being a parent when all I said literally a day prior was I was cripplingly lonely. They willingly put themselves out of the house on the weekends so I’m just alone. They won’t even take a single day to spend with me. The every next day they left me alone again. 

I feel like I’ve regressed back into a teenager. I would have been committed if my boyfriend didn’t take a fifty dollar Uber to get to me and stop the whole thing from happening. It’s making me feel more like a burden. I just want the pain to fucking stop. I wish they’d all just let me die."	1

"My suicide is inevitableI am 18 years old with a strong desire to kill myself. I am turning 19 in a few weeks. It’s almost like my suicide is bound to happen. I find myself feeling depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts most days. I have no irl friends. I’m not worthy of anyone’s time. I’m a pathetic human being that wallows in self pity with no intent to change myself. 

The only thing I am worthy of is a 12 gauge buckshot shell to the roof of my mouth. I’m going to kill myself before I graduate college. I do not want to be alive to see myself spiral into a life of loneliness, self-loathing and misery. I’d rather be dead. "	1

I wish something would kill me so people wouldn't have to remember me as the one who killed themselvesDon't worry, I won't actually kill myself apparently or I'd have done it already. I just want to share this ridiculous frustration with how I WOULD be perceived after death, isn't that silly? If I'm dead why would it matter to me... but you KNOW there's a difference in how people view the... resulting dead from the tragic accident of being hit by a car crossing the street vs the horror of being murdered vs the struggle of a terminal illness vs the... shame? of killing yourself like damn dont you wish you could control that one thing	1
"It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.

The reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was ""normal"".

Ever since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. 

On the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell ""DO NOT ANSWER ME!"". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.

This is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I ""screw up"".

And the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those ""male tears"" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.

And ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you."	1

"It's been One YearI kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.

However, this past ""anniversary"" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?

There's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.

There's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed. If I can't even appreciate the year since my last attempt, what's the point?"	1

"fuck it, im over this shitI Thought losing weight would make things better. “I just need abs and I’ll be happy”. I still look in the mirror and see the fat kid who shoved bags of Doritos into his mouth daily. I Thought going to college and having fresh faces and a fresh start would stop the feelings deep down. It didn’t. Thought finding a girl to be happy with would make me happy. It didn’t. Thought starving myself to finally make my body how I always wanted it to look would help make me feel better in the long run. It didn’t. Everyday I wake up wishing I hadn’t. I still get out of bed and try every day though. Some days are better than others. Today was amazing. Spent the entire day with a beautiful girl. Her laugh and smile made me laugh and smile. Yet here I am at 1am with suicidal thoughts. I fight a losing  battle every fucking day man. Things aren’t getting any easier. I’ve realized I have no passions. No hobbies. No real drive for anything in life. I feel so lost everyday. I don’t know how much longer I can hold out honestly. The only reason I haven’t jumped off a building yet is because it would ruin my family. I love my little sisters and I know how much it would impact their lives to attend the funeral of their big brother. Guys your big brother is trying, I really am. I just want to be happy but every day is somehow worse than the last. I’m sick of picking myself up just to be knocked down again. Fuck this cycle. 

If anyone ever ends up reading this - know I did it because I woke up one day and wasn’t strong enough. I’m sorry, don’t blame anyone but me."	1
It’s 5:30pm where I am. I’m killing myself by 10pmThere’s no complete way to explain why this is my only option. I’ve tried everything I could to get better, but I just get more and more depressed. When I thought it couldn’t get any worse, it did. Life shit on me and then shit on me again. I have no doubt that so many people have it worse than I do. I know this makes me weak. But it doesn’t make a difference anymore. I can’t do it. I’ve tried. I’m so sorry.	1
Is it worth itI don’t remember a time in my life where I’ve ever been truly happy or content. I don’t know if it’s worth fighting the battle anymore. I keep hearing things about why I should stay alive, but they all feel shallow and none of the reasons feel like they’re for myself. I’m just tired of it. Maybe self care is suicide.	1

I want to kill myself even though I’m afraid to.I’m tired of dealing with life. There are these entities (the beings) that put thoughts in my head. They’ve told me that someone will kill me soon. Some think it will be by my 19th birthday, others think it’ll be my roommate when I go to college. I’m scared of dying, but I’d rather kill myself than be killed, because I don’t know how I’ll be killed and I’d like it if my death were not extremely painful. I could get tortured first or anything. That won’t happen if I kill myself. But I’m also scared of going to hell. Some of the beings tell me that I’m going to hell when I die, but the nicer ones have told me not to worry about hell because God will protect me. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. My mom and my psychiatrist and therapist don’t think that the beings are real but they are. But the thing is they’re not omniscient and they can only make predictions, I’ve learned. I could end up killing myself for nothing. None of the beings have told me not to kill myself. Well not until this very moment when I realized that. Some of them want me to kill myself though. Many of them want me to kill myself. I really didn’t feel this bad until this evening.	1

"Today was my “Sweet 16” Sorry if my flair is wrong, but I think its the most appropriate one, anyways on with my post.

Today was my birthday, specifically my “sweet 16” I didn’t really do much today, and I guess I feel... kind of disappointed? It’s not like I really have any friends or am good at socializing so I couldn’t have a birthday party anyways, but still not doing much other than getting Denny’s has left me feeling like I didn’t get the magic of a birthday, especially one that’s typically considered on of your landmark birthday (your 1st, your 10th, your 13th, your 16th, your 18th, and your 21st are the ones I think are typically the big ones.) my birthday is almost over anyways (it’s 11:31 PM here) so I’m not sure why I’m really posting anything, but I kind of just felt like making a post somewhere where others may understand. Maybe I’m just getting older or something and birthdays lose their joy with age.

Anyways, thanks to anyone who decided to even just read this far, I hope everyone else has a more fulfilling birthday this year and onwards, and that this week turns out well for everyone! :)"	2
"Please helpI'm 19, I'm in college, my parents are still together. I have a roof over my head, food on the table and a boyfriend that cares greatly for me. So what could possibly be wrong with me? Why do I hate everything so much? 

I'm so afraid that I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I'm not good enough for my parents or my family. I have virtually no friends. Nobody cares about me except for my boyfriend but I know I'm wearing him down.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't take this anymore. Please reedit, help."	1

Piling up I have severe depression and aspergers. I am 23. I'm gay. I cannot relate to people outside of a very small group of people and part of how I learned to relate to others is through drugs. I am on and off but don't really associate with my old friends who still use heavily pretty often. When I do I feel welcome though and not judged so long as I'm getting high with them. I don't have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure. I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left. Pretending that there was a place and people who gave a shit about me and escaping into that fantasy. I won't ever stop hurting and I don't have a life outside of feeling that pain anymore. 	1

why do i want to kill myself so badly when i'm 15i'm latavia. i'm 15. and last year around this time i was hospitalized for my panic disorder/anxiety attacks/major depression. now, i am extremely suicidal, and my thighs are cut up from me pouring out my inner hate onto them. i want to tell my mom, but i'm afraid i will get admitted to the mental hospital again, and i'm stressed out. tomorrow is my last day of work for the season, and i've already written my suicide note, and proofread it hundreds of times. i want to get help, but i'm scared to become 'that' kid. i don't wanna be known as that suicidal kid. but there's a huge lump in my chest. i'm sorry 	1
"I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?"	1

"I don't really like my therapistI know therapist are supposed to help you challenge things about yourself or tell you things you don't want to hear. We almost got into an argument my last session.
I don't feel comfortable sharing my suicidal thoughts with anyone except warmlines.
Her tough love approach comes off as bitchy to me.
I know it is important to challenge our perception and we never know anything for certain.
I honestly think at some point, I know when someone is being condescending towards me. No one directly says it. I read tone, actions and body language. Sure there are million reasons someone's body language may seem condescending but that doesn't negate my opinion.

Sometimes I feel like she doesn't respect my opinion or is too rational."	1
"Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice neededI (19M) have been struggling tremendously with OCD, especially recently, and my recent intrusive thoughts are causing me tremendous anxiety and rumination.

Relatively recently (think a few weeks/months ago), I messaged multiple girls from nsfw subreddits such as gonewild.  Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didn’t know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

I don’t know how valid it is, but I’m just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that I’m going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  I’m incredibly anxious that I’m in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.

I swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.    All the subreddits that I found the people I messaged were strictly 18+.  It’s a question of what if.  This is really bothering me, please help."	1
"How many neglect posts are in this sub-reddit?I go on this sub-reddit a lot as someone who struggles with mental disorders. I myself have suicidal thoughts, but I’m not exactly suicidal I  a sense. I’m just really young and confused about how I feel about the world. I get a little sad thinking about all the long, heartfelt posts that are put on here that people just scroll past. People will scroll past this one too. 

I makes me think a lot about how people just pick and choose what they want to see for their own happiness. It’s a weird feeling. I feel bad for these people who aren’t getting this necessary attention from a group of people they are trying to share their hardest  struggles with, but then it also makes me feel weirdly good I’m not the only one who is neglected by the open public. I see one post with hundreds of upvotes, but the next with ten. The thing that saddens me is that there is no way to fix that. Just like the real world, we can’t fix and help everybody, and our standpoint is to always help ourselves first. This is really random but whatever."	1

[Question] I am not suicidal, however, i dont mind dying.I feel that life just goes on, nothing really interesting matters and if i were to die tomorrow it wouldnt really matter. Is this normal? It is an easy method for me to cope with stress or tackling failure, if it happens i could always just off myself. I dont know if this is healthy, sorry if this isnt the right place to ask.	1

"Ideation ended up in making a noose tonight.Or trying too. Or experimenting with putting the belt around the shower rail. Even though I had no real intention of killing myself, I did put my head in and let it choke me a bit and possibly hoped I’d slip and accidentally end up hanging myself.

I feel like I’m too sensitive for this world. And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when I’m scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because I’m too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts I’d got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know it’s basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just can’t help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesn’t matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I don’t feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits weren’t enough and I feel like I’m just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From ‘soulmate’ to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like I’m too sensitive for a man, and that I’m not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. I’m 31 but I feel like I’ve been struggling for so long."	1

But I send screens of the chat to my friend and told it to EVERYONE. Now she's getting bullied but I just think that's bs because why tf wpuld you get bullied because you like someone?! So yeah.. that's it	2
"My boyfriend just broke up with me in a really horrible way and I need help thinking of good general insults and that kind of thing Icba to go into details but trust me he’s horrible and deserves it. Some details which might help with insults, he’s quite boring, not very good looking, has a small penis, he always thinks he’s right, he’s very arrogant and I’m younger than him.

"I am Inadequate...I am not in desperate need of attention, I do not have a rope around my neck, and I am not looking for sympathy. So just a fair warning, If you do not want to waste time listening to my useless rambling, there are others in more dire need than I.

To begin.. There have been multiple cases throughout my life where I have thought to myself that suicide is the only option, never actually done it before. Most of this is due to my depression that I have experienced throughout my entire life, built on with stress, worries, ect, ect... Recently A lot of extra shit has caused me to start sinking deeper and deeper into my weak sorrow. 

I have my first ever finals coming up tomorrow. I am a freshman, and since 4th grade I have had nothing aside from As with a B on the side every now and then. This year though, I am struggling to maintain a B-C average. I have been sick and unable to study or focus on my finals for around a week or more, and I am almost sick to think about taking my finals knowing that  I will probably flunk them, bringing even more dissapointment onto my mother, more than usual.

I don't want to go to in dept about my pity as you all have more important things to do than listen to a 15 year old Freshman whine and complain about his life.. I am looking for anyone to talk to, just to help me out, and through all of whatever I am going through. And if you made it this far reading this, I applaud and thank you."	1
"I am a bad person and I just wanna dieI just wanna end it all, I became this depressed, always angry, irritable guy that no one likes. I don't know myself anymore, my father texted me that Im just there when I need him, I tried to check if his okay and I texted him ""How are you dad?"" last monday but he didnt replied, so I just stoppped and now hes saying that. I don't know man, I just ruined all my relationships and no one understands, when I try to talk about it with other people, they say that theres others have worse life than you, or we all feel like that to bullshit, so I don't bother talking about it to anyone, nothing interests me and I just feel sadness, hollowness, anger, and jealousy for years now. I just wanna fucking end this because no one will really remmber me anyway. I'm just tired of trying to fix this but it just doesnt work"	1
"Anyone wanna be friends? 13 male looking for friends. Here is sum thing about me

At what point is suicide acceptable? How many more days/months/years do I have to wait?28 year old female over here woo fucking hoo. Been depressed suicidal on and off since I can remember. Couple of failed attempts in my teens. It's been 8 months since my depression hit hard again. I keep setting a date then moving it. At this point if I try I'm not going to fail. Gotta buy a gun still. Been doing my research on how best to succeed. Just trying to plot the end. At what age is it finally going to be reasonable to throw in the towel? Do I really need to wait it out for years until it becomes so blaringly obvious that this life isn't worth the trouble. Seems like I've already figured that out but I keep holding on just in case. Not many more years left before spinsterdom sets in. Maybe 30? If I can make it that long. I don't know something's gotta give. I'm no spring chicken. I don't want to grow old and alone. At a certain point my life goals will be out of reach and I'll be left with nothing. At that time suicide is fair. It's just. It's reasonable. At this time I'm just waiting for my father to die so I don't have anyone to hurt. Maybe I answered my own question when he goes I will too. I just feel like if I set a reasonable date and stick to it all this pressure will be lifted. I'll have a goal. Just make it through until that date. I can do that. it's the unending road thats daunting. If there's a date I can compartmentalize. I can rest easy knowing the end is in sight. But when???	1
"I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them. When I actually think deeply about it I realise how pointless they are.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

dOn'T wOrRy, I wont go through with this yet, I need some time to process this realisation."	1
Don't/Haven't left house. Alone. PC is Shit.. Don't know how much longer I can go. Losing my mind. I've been really riddled with anxiety/depression/agoraphobia since I was  a freshman in high school, I am now 24 (25 in july) I've only left my  house 20\~ times in 5+ years. All I do is sit in my room alone for 16+  hours a day. Eat my one meal I get per day. And play on the computer,  alone. My computer is straight dogshit and even that is starting to  drive me insane. I feel myself literally losing my mind. I don't want  help anymore. I've grown too comfortable in my misery. I'm trapped.	1
I’m tiredI’m really tired of mental illness and struggle and not knowing who I am. I’m tired of living for everyone else. I’m tired of being depressed. I’m tired of being pushed aside. I’m tired of being invisible. I’m tired of laying here and wondering when it will get better. I’m tired of knowing that I can’t be positive no matter how hard I try. The meds only help somewhat. I wanna sleep forever as cliche as that is, I don’t want there to be a heaven or hell. I just want there to be peace in death. I just wanna give up and be in peace.	1
i’m back on my drip💃 DONT TOUCH ME ***** YOU DO NOT EXIST	2
"A conversation we could both benefit from. I myself am not suicidal. But I have been before. 
I'm here to talk to whoever would love to talk to someone.  
I'm a 22 year old female who has been blessed with good opportunities in life. I had a terrible bout in high school where I felt I went insane. I felt I had no control over my emotions, thoughts, and at times my own actions. I was put on medication and was almost sure I self-diagnosed myself with BPD. Fast forward a few years and I quit the meds and am mentally stable, even truly happy. 

But the last month or two things have been dwindling it feels. I have always been a daily bud smoker, but my alcohol consumption upped and I'm feeling best when asleep. This morning I woke up feeling empty, nothing. I couldn't get myself out of bed and had to call into work. I spent all day sleeping because being asleep is almost like not being alive... a small coma. I wouldn't consider suicide these days, but also some days I really wouldn't mind not being alive. 

I'm a wonderful listener and a very open person. If you feel the need to speak with someone, I would love to give you company and support. "	1
What do I tell themI want to tell my friends and family but I’m afraid they will try to stop me. I want to die. I want this life to end but I feel so selfish telling them that my life is good when I plan on dying next week. I don’t know what to do. 	1
"A rant about what a miserable little shit I am.Time drags on forever. I feel dead inside and nothing besides something visceral, like food and masturbation, brings true joy to me. My only parent doesn't understand me and believes I'm just spoiled and that's the internet's fault somehow (that's common for people raised in USSR — they treat everone younger and their problems as soft and spoiled). My psychiatrist believes that depression is a teenage fad. I haven't made any friends since I was 12, and it was the only close friend I've ever had. We're parted now. I am truly alone. Entrusive thoughts about self-harm and suicide make cold run down my limbs.

I dream of going somewhere like Iceland, a remote small country where everyone knows each other, but I can't make myself work for it. I have no power left to do anything meaningful, I abandoned my studies and barely go to classes. I would love to hear anything in response, but I know that won't change anything for me, I act like I have no future."	1
Do you support child slavery? If you do good technoblade does too if not lmao y not	2
I’ve recently turned to alcoholIt works for a while but then you wake up with a hangover which fricken sucks, but it sure numbs the pain, I’m getting tired of living my life without friends and family, all I want in life is to be a husband and a father but In this world with my capability it’s not possible so I’m drinking just like my grandpa and my father and my brother all did. I don’t want to kill my self but it seems like an easy way out of this living hell I’ve been through treatment and counseling and all that before. I just wanna find an ounce of hope that’ll stop me from doing it.	1
"its a roller coaster that won't endthis happens every couple of months or so. I have depression and anxiety. I would like an actual assessment but thats for another discussion.

im in the middle of a deep low and I just am tired of the never ending cycle. i feel everyone would be much better if I wasn't around, or reliable. Ive been out sick for three days now. stomach flu plus this worsening deep depression.
im so tired of living. nothing will ever change. nothing will ever get better. doctors will never listen. its all a busness anyway. I work in health care. there is nowhere to go. "	1
I’m (not sure if this is the right sub ) tired of everyone telling me it not the deep it’s all in my head things will get better it’s been almost two fucking decades and I haven’t been okayMy first attempt failed a gun to my head at my lil brother and sisters grave and the gun jammed I’ve tried of talking I’m tired of tryin I just want stop being a fucking problem to everyone so I gave everyone a heads up in three years I won’t be here I told my mom and brother and haven’t told my girlfriend I might spare her that break up with her (so she won’t kill herself be she told me if I kill myself she’ll do the same )then just drive 5-6 towns over and blow my fucking brains out bc all the mental and physical abuse from my  older brother when I was a kid finally catching up I wrote my suicide note already and no one can change my mind I told my family if they try to stop me I’ll shorten it up to a fucking week	1

Please Help Me.Ive been going through a rough time where i dont feel like I'm being loved by my family and friends. Right now as I write this with tears in my eyes and a broken heart I am contemplating suicide. I just need to know that even a stranger can care about me	1
"Im trying, but things keep getting worseI got into a Masters course last year and have done quite well so far, only to realize that my college's professors simply do not know enough about the subject and are continuously placing obstacles in our path. My dissertation is also getting ruined by the tardiness of labs and my team member, who is too busy with her own research to care for mine. Yes, the most appealing solution would be to shift labs, but it is going to take me eons to do that, and my samples(which are biological) will get destroyed all the same. So even though i have put in more effort than most of my classmates, i am staring on the brink of failure and i badly want to give up.   
I don't have anything to live for except the fact that it will make my family unhappy. I have a few online friends i care for, but beyond that, i have no social life worth talking about. I decided to avoid relationships after my gf's death from cancer last year, which is again a source of continuous mental turmoil. And the therapists in my country are assholes, besides, i simply cannot spare any time for therapy.   
Why should i not die? Is there any point in continuing to embarrass myself further? People keep telling me about how these failures are making me stronger, but they're not. Im 26 and i should've completed my education long ago. This isn't a fantasy world where a person has unlimited resources and time. I have never come across a worse phrase than ""failures are the stepping stones of success"". Perhaps its applicable for people who don't have much to lose.   
But i am losing everything, and hopefully, i will soon lose my life as well. "	1

"I dont see any future in front of meGot shitty genetics worse than you can imagine ; internet is the only place i can barely socialize , have zero motivation to do anything , ugly and awkward 
Also people hate me before barely know about me , i get hated for no reason ...

One year ago i was doing better , i thought things are finally getting better but no returned to the where i had started . Just shitposting on the internet and begging for the attention i couldnt get in the real life. 
And being depressed and numb all  the day. 

God knows that i still got dreams or hope but no one will accept me , i will always get hated and dumped for no reason .A person speaks me on the first meeting  ıt is good but on the second day they will dump me to the oblivion . This is a sick cycle ...

I cant see any hope now , light or anything , they say ıt will get better but when ?

"It is very unpleasant to hear a lot of 17 y/o teens talking about looking forward to finally becoming 18 to be able to do porn. I have become disappointed in our society. How is it possible that everything is already so over-sexualized that I hear from 16 and 17 year olds that they are looking forward to becoming 18 so that they can produce pornographic content?

I personally think this is a terrible development..."	2
"27I'm so tired of trying. I run in circles, every day is nothing new, I go from hope to excitement to disillusion. I know this whole cycle so thoroughly, my life is like a laughably bad book or a parody of some kind. And beneath this there is so much suffering and loneliness.

I don't want to work just so I can survive to work yet another month. I will never sell my mind to someone or something I don't believe in. And this alone is enough to be an outcast, both socially and professionally. I find it weird how we prevent people from killing themselves yet all follow and support structures that beat them to it without even realising it. Not like I have an answer, the past, present and future key to our survival is a well functioning and productive society, not the well being of free radicals. But I have to add that depression isn't an illness, the norm is. Depressed people are more likely to realistically judge a situation.

I'll try once again, and maybe a few times after that. But after a fixed age, and without any solid improvement, I'm just going to call it quits. I'll have years upon years of proof that life isn't worth it. I won't be repeating the same experiment and expecting different results."	1
"Guys, I'm writing a romance novel. How's the first draft? *It's just the first page and could probably use some work but it's pretty good imo 🤷‍♂️*

&amp;#x200B;

She sauntered into the room, her enormous breasts swaying from side-to-side like a great grandfather clock, glistening enticingly, her massive nipples clinging to the underside of the latex bra she just happened to be wearing at 2 PM on a Monday evening.

The throbbing mounds that adorned her colossal melons seemed as if to emit a high-pitched grown. A dog whistle of sorts. A siren call that made my 18-inch penis immediately stand at attention like a marine in the dog house.

I stumbled over to her, my massive shaft swaying from side-to-side, rocking the whole house with it. Upon closer inspection, her giant conkers were even more impressive that I'd first thought. Sprinkled lightly with freckles, like a perfectly peppered biscuit, she had the most beautiful bongos I'd ever gazed upon.

I let out a primal yell and immediately entered her, causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust. We were still clothed. Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris. Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain, I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory. This wasn't my first sexual encounter. I've had sex with at least 9 other women. Still, something about this one was special.

Still inside her, I could feel her ovaries trembling. My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot, now spurting from her mouth as if a great cum-fountain. 

""You like that bebe?"" I grumbled.

Her nipples gazed at me with lust and thirst.

I spent the rest of the afternoon tenderizing her meat oven with my man hook."	2

"So last night I took a painful L Last night me and this girl were FaceTiming and we were going for a little while and she came to the point to tell me how she liked me and since I have a low self esteem I felt accomplished cause I felt like she was way out of my league.Anyways she keeps bringing it up with her friend as well then we hang up and it’s around 3:00am I go to sleep happy thinking and feeling accomplished 

Fast forward to this morning she texts me that she was just joking around with me and tbh it really hurts.Anyways just wanted to say I took a very painful L."	2
"I think I will do itNot right now. But soon. I've just had enough. 

I'm 27 year old female. My story is this:

My dad was violent and alcoholic in my youth. Me and my siblings got used to live in fear. My mother ditched him when I was seven, only 'cause my little brother got cancer (if he would've gotten abused while being sick, he could've died). He survived, but I was always put aside (naturally, 'cause he was sick and I was healthy). I was good at school, I've always liked it. Fast forward to age 15. I was raped. It ruined me. I started to drink (a lot), and to hang with older guys. I started to date one. I moved in with him when in high school. Drinking was our favorite hobby. He also introduced me to some drugs (cannabis, LSD, MDMA etc.) Then... I tried to kill myself. I nearly succeeded (death was few minutes away). I went to hospital for a while and when I got back to home, I continued all my bad habits.

Now I'm in university, but I just can't do THIS anymore. I should've graduated half an year ago, but I'm lazy and stupid. Also my fiancee (formerly mentioned as the old guy) hates me nowadays. I'm disgusting, stupid water buffalo in his opinion (yeah, I've gained weight and I don't look like a 16 years old anymore). It's sad 'cause I know it's true. I hate myself and I'm sad for all my relatives 'cause they need to pretend to care for me.

I just know that my life isn't going to get any better. I am shit and my life is going to be shit. I'm just done."	1
Quick question When you brush your teeth in the morning (if you do), do you brush before or after breakfast?	2
Feeling horribleI don't think I wanna live anymore. I've caused too much pain to too many people and I just don't deserve to live anymore.... I wish there was another way to solve this problem but seems like death is the only way out. I just don't know what to do, I feel so helpless. I feel like the world would be a much better place if I just left....I've always felt worthless and pathetic and I feel like ending my life would be so much easier. Thanks for listening to me :(	1

I'm sore inside and I'm tiredI fell in love again. Stupid right? Same thing that happens every time I over share and I fall too quickly and it's not even just that. I suffered abuse with my ex and I'm broken after that. Things have never been the same inside me. Normally I can shake it off and carry on but this time I can't seem to get it right. I just want to be loved and needed and I can't even get that right. My career is fucked because of Covid and no real events happening at the moment. I want to finish my album as a goodbye, as a suicide note and once that's done I want to go and be with the stars again.	1

"It's my 22nd birthday and that's 22 too much for me**+++ For the record, I'm not following any of the shit ideas my head has. At least don't intend to. +++**

All my life I've been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata. I am alone, I have no family as they are totally shitty. My ""friends"" also abandoned me, I'm just not good enough or too annoying.

One of the first things I did around midnight (almost 1am now) is posting a depressing meme to reddit which I prepared an hour before. Whilst crying. I am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here. I feel dead inside and at the same time like I'm about to explode.

My head is constantly having thoughts like ""What could we do today? What about overdosing on painkillers or so?"" or before when I was in a subway thinking that I should better be below it and that's really annoying. Also I know that it's not the best way anyway and I wouldn't want to involve others in such a thing. That'd be awful. It is my 22nd birthday and I feel like I should ask for an apology that I wasn't aborted. Everyone resents me in the end and there's nothing I can do about it.

My whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom I also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if I committed suicide. I just wanna vanish. I can't because I lost someone to suicide and this feeling - I just can't make the ones I love feel like that. As much as I want to cease to exist.

I. Hate. Everything.

I don't know what to do and I don't know why I am even writing this when I don't actually intend to do anything? Whatever. In a month I am 2 years selfharm-free (used to cut myself heavily) and even that doesn't cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope. Eating disorder flaring up so I get at least a fake sense of control. Maybe I die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15%. But maybe another of my diseases gets me first.

I have chronic pain and it's awful. I just want to stop that. I want it to end. It hurts. My body as well as my mind. I can't handle it."	1
opinions on this type of relationship A friend(f15) of mine has recently became interested in a guy (m18). She said he is super sweet and funny but I think it is a little weird. She told him she liked him and he told her he liked her back. I just feel like its kind of weird but at the same time I guess its okay as long as they aren't doing stuff. I don't know I guess I just wanted to know what you homies thought of this.	2

I couldn't do itI'm 18 and I'm college at a decent school. I always had plans for my life. I wanted to graduate college and become a commercial airline pilot and marry the only girl I've ever loved. Well my grades had been terrible because I just don't have the motivation to try as hard as a i used to, it's like I don't even care anymore. I figured I would figure it all out and it would be okay. The only thing that made me happy in my life is when I was with my girlfriend and making her happy is what gave me the little motivation that I had. She decided to leave me and she's now back with her old boyfriend and other than a couple of my friends I have no reason to live now. But anyways, I was sitting in my room thinking about killing myself and I grabbed my belt and put it around my neck and shut it in the door I leaned forwards and I started to pass out and it was like a natural reaction to just reach back and open the door stopping myself from dying. How can I just get it over with?	1
"I’m not good enough and I never will be.I hope I’m posting to the right subreddit, not sure exactly where to put this. 

I will never be good enough for anyone. I’m a failure. I’ll never do anything worth while in my life. I’m constantly getting yelled at and pushed around and no one understands what it does to me. My entire life I’ve been left by people, my biological parents, my adoptive dad, my step dad, my ex boyfriend. Friends come and go like crazy and no one seems to want me. I do everything to make people happy, to make people stay, but they don’t. I’m in university, not doing well and tracking on a dead end degree. My weeks are the same, dragging through classes and drinking it all away on the weekends. I don’t see a future. I’m tired of people telling me, it’ll get better, keep trying, find new hobbies! I’m bad at everything. I’m a piece of shit. I’ve been self harming for the past seven years but I’ve never gone deep enough. I don’t have access to any pills. I don’t know how to kill myself but I don’t see another way. I try to find little things to make me happy but once I close the door to my room and I’m all alone, none of it was enough. I always end up feeling empty and alone. No one is gonna wanna be with me, I’m depressed and negative. I’m not particularly attractive and the people who do show interest only want a quick fuck. I just want someone to want me but who would ever want me?"	1

"Not sure exactly when but I’ve decided this is it. 32 (female)It’s been a long time a coming. I’ve had suicidal thoughts for more than half of my life (since about 15 years old). 

The older I get the lonelier I get, the more defective I feel.

My therapist essentially said I was “not attractive” today. Something I worried he thought and thanks to growing up with a very vain mom, that stuff mattering is ingrained in me. I slept around with random guys for the first time in my life last year. I wanted to feel “wanted”; it backfired. He said that once we really get into last year it won’t be that “you are not attractive” (along with a list of other things that I can’t remember for the life of me cus his saying that took over it all) that will be the core of what eats you up about it. I’m paraphrasing. 

He just tried calling now cus I kept texting him. I inadvertently hung up on him.

I’m just done with the world. I’m 32 and I still feel like a suicidal 15 year old."	1

Sad downfallI’ve been looking through this subreddit for a long time. I’ve noticed that people comments used to be full of love and support. Now it’s comments from other suicidal people saying “just do it and end the suffering.” These times are so hard and it’s just heart breaking. The people here that used to rescue each other are now the ones crying for help, only to be met with “me too.” It’s the damn pandemic. I’m sorry it came to this. I’m not blaming the people who comment “same” and “just do it” because me too. I wanna just do it. And I understand why I’d want someone else to just do it too. I know dying is better than the suffering too. It’s just an observation, not hate. The frequency of posts increasing (at least to me it seems to be) is also just really heart breaking. Stay strong guys. Suffering is hard and I understand why you’d want to do it.	1

I am a 16 year old student that is constantly bullied and have bad grades. I don't really think I'm worthy to be suicidal, but I constantly feel like ending my life, because it feels like I will never have to face problems again. The solution I have come across multiple times is to ask for help. I told my parents, and they told me I was being over-dramatic and attention-seeking. I told my friend, and he just laughed at me. I don't feel like anyone cares. Plus the way my grades are, i'm going to be a failure in life and be living with my parents forever, so, who cares if I'm not here?"	1
damnso there I was really wanting to kill myself but I knew I had to live just a bit longer I had some oxy from a few months ago when I was addicted to drugs but I wasn't addicted to oxy because I accidentally overdosed on it and so I never took it again but I had one pill left it was my last one because my dealer is on vacation and so I said fuck it and took it I had the best night of my life and then today I slept 6 hours after coming home from school. but the thing is Im not sure if its oxy thats what my dealer told me so because I've run out I realized that we had a shit ton of oxy in the medicine cabinet except it looks different ima try not to overdose this is the only think keeping me from ending it so fuck it.	1

well before you ask, the book is about a 13 year old named dasher who has a bond with a past brother named bullet in which bullet came to the future by finding a time machine to take him to the future.
Dasher on the other hand went to get gas as requested by his gfs mother and accidentaly sprayed the gas at himself while trying to turn it off. He swallowed the gas while bullet found dasher and done cpr and passed out as well. They both woken up in a hospital and discovered that they gotten supersonic speed and fire powers by burning the infinite oil source in his blood and can run like a car on gas but infinite and faster. Bullet on the other hand has ice power due to a reverse in his blood. They both discover that doctor ligma(or limpo) has come to the future and they must stop them along with the 2 robot replicas powered by the dash ruby.

"I don't even know why am I writing thisI feel so stuck, so bound in this situation.
In 3 hours I'm going at work again, where I'm going to suffer the same injustices everyone suffers everywhere at every job, and even worst, but really I can't take anymore those people being slower than me, and yet blaming me for things i shouldn't be blamed of. 
I had so many fights, but yet I can't revolt against them more than I already did cause I need this damn job.

So I'm super stressed at work but when I go back home there's my damn family situation, my mom says in 5 days the judge is coming to our home to see what can be taken away and sold so the state can get his tax money back, the ones my dad wasn't able to pay. ""Fortunately"" (I don't really care) they said if we give them 4000 euro right now they'll make us a payment plan for the restant 40000 euros... So I'll have to ""lend"" my money to my dad again (I know I'll never see them back) this month and the same story comes along every damn month.
My dad has debts everywhere, I don't even know how much, and my mom says I'll have to hold on for other like 3-4 years in this cursed situation. 
But this is just an random estimate. I'm forced in this situation, I'm 23 years old and don't know when I'll be free, maybe when I'll be 30?
Our home is under risk every month.

Then, even worst, my mom is sick, she can't work, my dad left and betrayed her, I DON'T love her but I feel forced to take care of here until she dies or takes away her own life.
I don't have any mental illness, I'd like to become a music producer, to make money, I think love is so stupid and I don't care for anyone other than my self, and I believe everyone is egoistic too in the deep inside, but yet I'm scared of death, feel so coward. Hanging hurts, ""mortal"" electrical towers are not mortal at all, the only thing I could do right now would be to take the knife I usually take to my job, which has a new sharp blade and cut my throat but I'm so scared of how it would hurt, and I'm so stupidly worried about the shock I'll cause to my mom...
I just feel bond and powerless..."	1

How do you not want to kill yourselfSo I’m in a dark place. Been here for years. Tried to kill myself many times (obviously not successfully). And it hasn’t gotten any better. Sometimes I don’t want to die cause I’m sad, I just feel so unsatisfied with life and I feel like I never will be. I feel like I don’t like people but I hate being alone. I’ve moved away from all my friends and I’m lonely af. I cannot kill myself cause I don’t wanna cause pain to people but I also don’t really wanna live. I feel like I’m just waiting until everyone I love dies so I can kill myself or for something other than myself to just kill me. How do people find satisfaction in life?	1

I tried ro establish good friends and good and caring relationships. Ended cruel and seriously life damaging again.

Trying this againI don't know why I'm still trying. I keep going back to the feeling of wanting to end it all. I've been trying for so long. I've posted on /r/SuicideWatch before. Everything just keeps getting worse. Everyone keeps saying it'll eventually get better, but for years and years it just keeps getting worse. I'll hold out hope and something will happen that will make me think things are finally getting better, and then the other shoe drops and the rug gets swept out of under me. I'm in so much pain. Every day I get more and more resigned to the fact that my only two options are to either end things or accept the fact that I will always be in pain and just learn to deal with it as a shell for the sake of other people. I've tried to get help so many times, and it's like yelling from inside a soundproof glass cage. I want help so badly. I don't know what else to do.	1
I’d do anything to not feel suicidalI’m getting tired of just hangin in there... I don’t speak about this in real life because last time my suicidal attempts got brushed off as “attention seeking” from the doctor!!	1
"I dug deeper into the low, but I only feel stupidShort post. I like drawing. But now I think that the things that I'm drawing are nothing but edgy trash, with my mental health issues  cheaply splattered over bad art skills,  because I'm a shitty attention seeking idiot. I can't seem to be able to draw anything that isn't edgy.

I hate this word. Edgy. No wonder I can't look at my own art without feeling gross. 

I just read through other people's abuse histories and life struggles. And here I am, pondering what shade of ugu sobstory I wanna paint with, to represent my inner struggle of lying in a smelly bad and feeling sorry for myself.

If I am edgy, I want to die. I already am so many things. A dropout, dramatic, a loser, ugly, dirty,  probably very selfish and potentially abusive. A liar, vain. If the one hobby that brings me joy turns out to have been tainted, and wasted by my own trashy emo existence, I will kill myself. The last thing that I want to be is an edgy joke."	1
"I (15M) was FORCED by my ONLINE SCHOOL to CUT my HAIR because it was considered FEMININE and UNHYGIENIC. A month ago I was forced by my school to cut my hair because it looks feminine and unhygienic because it had a medium hair length (my family also supports this).

I loved and cared my hair for half a year then get it stripped away from me unwillingly. 

This somewhat traumatised me but I had to keep a happy face although I know I’m being constantly shamed by the system if I make a sad face because again it was considered too feminine.

I had lost weight even though I was already underweight and haven’t slept a lot ever since, I also considered jumping off my balcony multiple times but somehow I’m still living.

And now I’m considering getting a buzz cut as a power move, I would probably never do it but I’m just thinking about it."	2

"don’t get too connected to ur internet friends fr it never turns out good for me (ik lots of people have great friendships that they made over discord)

example: me and this girl we used to talk so much and we had some things in common like both trying to stop self harming other things so we talked A LOT but as i should have expected it ends terrible for me but she just moves on to someone else

pretty much everyone i considered a great friend said that they got tired of me which hurts and i can’t figure out what i did wrong, i guess i wasn’t online enough.  one guy from switzerland (i’m from england) met on discord and we woke on snap , friends enough for me to be doing his english homework for him. but again one day he starts getting toxic and now he’s blocked me 

tldr: everyone i considered a friend on the internet left me confused and hurt"	2
Any advice on getting a summer internship? I normally don't post in this subreddit but I felt like you guys could help me out with this.

"My friend says he gives up, and might kill himselfA few hours ago my friend whom I have known for a few years, but never met in person messaged me over Skype saying that him and his girlfriend (who I also am good friends with, and have never met) just broke up on their anniversary, and that he might kill himself. He said that more and more people have betrayed and back-stabbed him, and that his girlfriend was his last anchor. He also told me that he had already taken two handfuls of pills two days ago, but it was unsuccessful. He said ""bye"" and turned his pc off. Him and his girlfriend were in somewhat of a long-distance relationship, and I do not know where he lives, nor his phone number. I feel so helpless, and don't know what to do. "	1

It was my own stupidity that got me here in the first place. So many opportunities that I wasted and now I'm fucked. 

No social life. At all. Only have 4 friends who I can't even bear to talk to because of my situation. 20 years old never been to a party, out past 1:00, drunk, nothing. I've done fuck all. 

No self esteem due to years of bullying on and off, leading to me thinking I'm a disgusting ugly piece of shit which causes a plethora of issues. 

No money. 

No job. 

Fail most job interviews that I do manage to get because of my depression and social anxiety. And whenever I do by some miracle manage to get into employment my depression/anxiety fucks it up and I end up on the brink of being fired or I leave due to the stress. 

Failing education because I'm so depressed with my shit empty life that I can't think straight. 

Family think I'm a scrounging, lazy burden.

I need help I’m scaredI need help because I’m afraid that I might hurt myself. I’m 13 and I have knives in my closet and I’m afraid I might use them. I need someone to talk to because I feel like I’m worthless and no one wants me. Yesterday, I walked around asking people to sign a petition that said I sucked and I filled both sides of the paper and I’m scared of dying. I recently met someone who I really thought cared, so I talked a lot about suicide around them but I couldn’t bring myself to actually ask for help. But here I am now, I know I’ll regret this in the morning but I need to do this. The person I talked about, I thought I might be annoying them so I’ve stopped talking to them. I feel like a worthless piece of trash and I want to die. None of this makes since but all I know is there’s cuts on my arms and my wrists are hurting and I’m scared. Please help.	1

"Nobody is going to see thisThere's no good way to articulate how I'm feeling. but I'll half-heartedly try as I can feel everything around me spiral(I took some pills) I'm so done. I've given up. I tried some. But I'm out of steam. Nothing budges, it will always be the same. Or at least an endless loop... a stupid cycle that will never escape. I need to be better. I can be better. Yet at the same time, I can't and never will be. My brain is completely fried, endlessly blank, or continuously searching.

When my mind is underwhelmed by its own-self it desires something to feed it, knowledge, art, music. Just something. When you throw it for a loop, everything goes haywire. I collapse. I cry. Every emotion grounding me to my own character no longer holds up. Nothing feels real

But maybe its just experience. Maybe that's all it wanted. The human experience. To live-life. To stop floating. I don't want to argue with you. I don't want to upset you. I don't want you to hate me. So I'll give up my fight, compress my stupid fkin emotions. I'll stop being around you, you probably just pity me. ugly me, stupid me. Annoying weirdo. look at her- she must hate everyone- that's why she doesn't talk to anyone- its cause shes antisocial and ill. So full of herself. She must be.{ while the thought of someone I know maybe committing suicide (because of certain signs) throws me into panic}

I don't care anymore. there's only a small ass fraction of me that dose. and i've drowned it. I swear I did

But I'm just an asshole to my parents. who are assholes to me. Just what I deserved. A miserable life without anyone. Its what I get. I deserve the worst. SO many people have been through worse than me. My life isn't that bad you stupid fuck. stop complaining. STOP STOP STOP. make it stop

It's really silly, isn't it?

How a simple hobby was the last thing keeping you grounded and sane.

Now its gone cause I'm a lazy piece of ADHD shit

Maybe I can starve myself again. 

I need to cope somehow. crying to your parents (as they dismiss it as me having a teenager tantrum) while subconsciously thrashing your head into the wall in frustration is just gonna make your dad slap you

Your mom wants you to starve, she keeps not so subtly pointing out things that very obviously correlate to my weight gain. She refers to the time that she very well knows I was starving myself (She said that I was, and mentioned the fact I was after the fact) as me being healthy. Even if I pointed it out she would deny and twist it. Cause she's a fucking liar. (she always does that when I point out whatever she is doing) then bring on any other subject about me doing things badly and wrong to my face and continue on.

 I don't know who I am. Neither do you. Nor will anything. 

I give up. figuring anything and everything has driven me to insanity.

How are people able to go on discord so easily? I have been in the App Store trying to download discord for the past 30 minutes. Not because it won’t download, it’s because I keep on thinking about how everything could go wrong. And it’s making me more nervous to download it. I just want some help on ARGs. But what if they’re on a call? Phone calls are terrifying, for a girl I have a deep voice, so what if they don’t like my voice? Or what if they think I’m stupid. Texting people is short of okay, but calling is another thing. (Just so you understand I have social anxiety)	2
ExhaustedI’m so tired. Physically it’s hard to get out of bed. Mentally it’s hard to focus on work. Emotionally it’s hard to be in any relationship. I skip school and practice because I’m sick.

And honestly I’m not loving I’m surviving doing the same thing every day for what? I don’t want to get better. I know I have to but everyone thinks I’m fine so I can’t even get help if I wanted to. I’m so tired of this.	1

"Almost drove myself to death todaySo I often have those suicidal thoughts coming from out of nowhere but I never got close to actually translate them into action because I know what it's like if someone you know or even love takes his own life. 

However, today my group got a pretty bad feedback for our presentation and overall work although I've worked very hard for it. I'm in university and work 20 hours a week to be able to actually live and not have to be too careful with money. 

The feedback and overall stress somehow triggered me. Why am I even doing this? I have a job that earns me a lot of money, I study mechanical engineering and I'm living together with a very loving and caring girlfriend. It wasn't easy to achieve all of this but I thought if I force myself to put in some energy to make it better I'd actually feel better. But I don't.  I even feel worse.

 I got in my car and drove home with very loud music, like a maniac. Way too fast, ignoring every rule you could possibly think of hoping to crash and die eventually.  I even almost drove off a bridge once and into a wall thrice but changed my mind seconds before the impact every time.

So after half an hour I arrived home alive and well, unfortunately. Didn't even get stopped by the Police or anything. Pretty weird experience."	1

"Getting concerned and scaredI had acquired both depression and anxiety some years ago; have been relatively stable on meds for a while now.

I don't really have a history of being suicidal, always been too scared of death. At worst, I'd get ""bursts"" of feeling like ending it but it would usually happen once every few months and would never last long.

Now, however, I am getting increasingly concerned. Got the invasive thoughts and desperation, if you will, two or three days ago. Except, this time, they are not going away. Quite the opposite, even. To make matters worse, I was going to bring it up at my psych appointment this week but it got cancelled.

I can't say I will attempt anything at this current state but I doubt I can last long.

It's scary."	1
"It's ny birthday today and also the day that I was supposed to kill myself.My depression started when I was 7 years old and I remember promising myself that if I was still dealing with this by the time I was grown up, that I'd kill myself.


Today I turned 18 years old and the thought is still with me. I wrote a note 2 years ago and its still sitting in my desk. The plan was to buy a gun and shoot myself, but plans don't always work out. Now I can't get the thought of starting my car and just sitting in the garage out of my head.


In the past few months, things have changed though. I haven't been happy, but I don't feel sad anymore. I don't know if this is what people mean when they say it gets better, but I guess it did get better.


Now I'm just laying in bed wondering what I should do with my life or if I should start the car. I just feel so confused right now."	1

"I'm losing my sanity. Relativity is killing me.I figured I need to say something about this... For my sake that is. I'm beginning to lose reality on a weekly basis again. I used to lose it for months at a time in a big swing but now its more frequent. I'm beating myself up constantly and purposefully forgetting to eat so I get that much weaker every day in hopes that I die soon. 

Wow. saying that to you strangers is humbling for myself to know that I'm really getting down that low. I'm about 85% certain I'm going to die by suicide in my life. The question is when. How soon. A month, a year?, an Hour?. Knowing that I'm preparing to die is oddly somewhat comforting... cause it numbs the pain. 

AM I pLANNING my death for a areason!? Am I just trying to get people to know that I'm not okk?? I'm just so lonely all the time but I'm petrified to tell anyone that my brain is decaying as if it's already DEAD. Am I just trying to escape a future that I don't want to write and fill with memories because I'm too afraid to get hurt again and take out the pain on myself like I always have. I really don't want to post. I don't want to read reply's but I don't want to not be honest with myself. Dammit I just wanna f'in die... don't feel a need to respond. I don't need sympathy.

"I've day dreamed of killing myself since I was a child...No throwaway, nothing like that. I've tried describing this feeling to my parents, but even with history of trauma I grew up in not the best house hold. No father, mother working two jobs, brothers and sisters all much older. My oldest brother has almost a 20 year age difference on me.

Anyways, I don't know why. It's something I've tried to be vocal about but I find that in modern days those who ""want to help"" are far more fucking annoying than those who will just have a logical conversation with ideas, opinions, facts, thoughts to be shared. 

I'm not going to kill myself this second, nor do I plan on it. But I do often day dream of killing myself, how it'd affect others. And more recently, the past year or so after experimentation with pot, women, and living I really got a new perspective. I was no longer that basement dwelling kid who played video games all day, but instead I'd smoke, bang hot chicks, and have friends. 

Well that's how everyone wants me to live my life, but I don't, and I can't be happy doing what I used to do. I find that more often than not, as of recent, I've wanted to kill myself not for the harm and sadness it'd cause others, but more because I can no longer take others...

It's not easy communicating with people who don't understand, aren't too bright, or just generally don't even process your information even when they seem to be hearing the words you're saying. My family, it's not very easy... a lot of addicts, but not junkies... worse. Functioning, middle class, addicts. 

The happy glow on the outside quickly becomes the regular fighting, pill popping, and drinking. 

I'm at a point where there's nothing here left for me, I'm still youngish, 18. But I've lived a pretty eventful life, I've had a lot of amazing opportunities to work with people I looked at as celebrities (On YouTube) due to my work in Graphic Design, Animation, and entertainment. I've had thousands of hours of laughs and smiles, and perhaps just as many in the real world as I did the online world.

I don't suppose there's a point to any of this, but I feel like I wanted to just tell somebody. I have a female friend in another state, we've known each other for many years now and I don't know. I want to tell her I love her, but I don't. I don't love her, she likes me a lot, but to me she's the only person I have mentally/intellectually. I can't converse or discuss anything with anyone else seemingly, I had a bad break up like half a year back and I was happy before that? I think, and before the girl I broke up with. I don't know, my point is, I know I don't love the first girl, my friend so I instead went and hugged my mother and told her I loved her, and she gave me a groan and a pissy face unlike normal (normal meaning, the other ~4 times I've gone up to my mom in that manner, hugged her, and told her I loved her in the past year). I know its' just because of her current situation, having to go down to my sisters' house to wash clothes, and my brother getting on her nerves... ugh, I used to love the kid, seriously. But I can't stand the fucking sight of my own brother anymore. I think I'm gonna leave soon, not leave leave. But I need some space. 

I want to delete this, all of this, just as I have many posts similar in the past. But I'm just going to see what happens, and if anyone of you can help, can explain to me what's going on this fucking skull because it feels like a process is using all of my brains CPU and I'm fucking overworked and overloaded but I fucking do nothing all day besidAwzsedX "	1

"I don't know what to do or how much longer I can keep on going.People say ""it gets better"" but this has been going on for almost a decade now and it's only getting worse. Now I'm afraid I'll have to do it for another decade. Every time I see one of those ""reasons to live"" lists, I can never relate to any of it. I can't turn to my family because my mother abused me and my father never did anything about it, because he didn't want to ""deal with her"" either, since he was too stressed or tired from work. My mother got rid of my cat when I was 15 as punishment. I've never been able to form any sort of real relationships, because I kept lying about myself and pushing people away out of shame of how bad my life really is. I don't have things I enjoy either anymore, but just things that help me escape reality for a short time. And now I'm slowly burning through my life saving because I can't bring myself to look for a job anymore because I'm so sick of feeling ""not good enough"" every time I get rejected. I'm at the point where I barely stop myself from breaking down and crying in public places. I'm so incredibly lonely and have absolutely nobody to talk to. Only person I have any sort of attachment to is my younger sister who is too young to understand what I'm going through and I don't know if I can keep on living purely just to not make her sad. I just don't know what to do anymore. At this point I just want someone to hold me, tell me they love me and tell me what to do, because I'm tired of making decisions that never seem to be any good."	1

"GuiltyFor context, I have a scat fetish, don’t judge please, I didn’t choose to have it.     
     
A while ago, when I was like 17, I was at a gathering and watched a high school girl go upstairs where I knew the bathroom door didnt shut all the way. Knowing this, I went upstairs after them and hid in a bedroom trying to hear them use the bathroom. I honestly don’t remember what happened after that but I think I thought about intentionally walking in on them. I don’t remember them leaving the bathroom and  im pretty sure i didnt even hear anything but I feel like I violated their privacy. I feel super guilty about this and have been agonizing over it for weeks. I feel like this is the furthest extent of my fetish and that it took over in my head and overruled my moral judgement. I think of myself as no better than a rapist or something because of this, even though I know it’s irrational. I can’t get over this. I also have depression and OCD"	1
"Help Me...PleaseI'm in so much pain. I've had Sciatica for 8 months now, and it's only gotten worse. Sure, the chronic migraines and headaches are still there, but this is ridiculous. I'm at a consistent 7 on the pain scale, whereby hydrocodone takes it only down to a 5 for 2 hours. 

I can't afford the MRI I need to be able to get a Cortizone steroid shot in the disc area of my back. I can't afford any more chiropractic nor physical therapy. I can't afford to see my therapist anymore.

My landlord also decided to not continue my lease for next year. I told them I wasn't sure if I was going to move, they took that as a yes and already rented out my room just telling me today. I have no energy nor pain free time to clean my room, let alone find a new place to live. I have around 30 days.

My credit is show because I have a 400 dollar medical bill In collections since November....and I'm not going to be able to afford rent this month. I can't work the hours needed to survive, some days I'm in just to much pain.

I can't do this anymore. America doesn't allow me to live and be in pain. I can't afford to eat, be pain free....I'm sick of wrestling and tossing and turning in bed trying to find some relief every hours OF THE GOD DAMN DAY. I'm sick of waking up at 5 am in pain, I'm sick of having no security or safety in my life.

"I don't know why I'm here.Every part of my family is dying off one by one. I spend my days going through the motions but my mind isn't in it anymore. I hardly remember what I do on a daily basis. I'm continually slipping further away.

Since my mom died, I've been ready to follow her into the grave. But one morning I realized that my death would leave my sister in a worse position. I've spent months feeling like I'm having a heart attack, blood clot, or any number of deadly conditions. 

None of this matters. Everyone is going to leave. Family is supposed to be there for you forever but they won't be. They'll move on be it through death or any number of instances.

I wish I were never born. I wish I could have chosen if I wanted to exist. It seems pretty fucked up that we don't get a choice. It's a pretty big decision. I wish I had died as a child. I wish I had never seen the things I have.

Everything is boring or stupid. I can't fucking stand people anymore. Their little stupid quips here and there. They all think they're fucking special but they're not. No one is. This planet would be better off is half of us died anyway.

I can't get out of bed before noon, and I can't resist the urge to nap or else lay in bed staring at the walls for hours a day.

We all like to pretend that everything is a-okay. We like to think that ""we're strong as long as we're in this together"" or some bullshit. But you know what? Not a single one of us has some mystical power that makes things okay again. We're all fucking helpless.

I pushed it all down for years. I hid from the emotion and refused to acknowledge the issues. I was nicknamed ""Hitler"" in highschool because shit just rolled off my back. But everything has rolled into the station - full fucking steam ahead.

What am I supposed to do? Just be okay? Pretend that nothing happened? That shit doesn't just go away. There's no fucking magical potion that takes all the memories away - aside from bleach I guess - but memories make the person.

I heard some girls driving along in their fancy car with their family/friends. They had the windows down and were laughing loudly in traffic. I should be happy that someone else can find happiness, but I fucking hate them. I hate that little ignorant bitches can be happy like that. Their stupid high pitched squeals. They think they're so fucking special. But one day, three of the four people in that car will be dead, and one girl will remain. I wonder if things will be better for her. Who knows, they might be worse.

Why can't the planet just explode all at once?

I don't feel close to anyone the way I used to. I don't feel close to my boyfriend or my friend of 13+ years. Or my sister. Though I can identify with her a little more than anyone else. But people just annoy me. Lately, I can't stand people dropping by my house. I'm always happy for the first minute they show and up, and I'm happy for the first minute after they leave. But when they're around, I can't connect at all. I find myself staring at them, nodding but not really hearing whatever it is they're talking about. I just stare. Sometime I think about how they can be so fucking happy, and other times I just stare.

I find myself staring at people in public too, sometimes hating them and other times not thinking at all.

I feel like I'm eking a little closer to insanity with each passing second. Why do people even try? After everything, we're all going to die anyway. Why does it matter if someone died today or years from now? It's just speeding the inevitable. Life is agony. I live for the next moment I can finally fall asleep again.

Story timeSo one time, I stayed up till 1 AM, and my dad found me, and I feel asleep balling my eyes out, but the funny thing is that the only thing that would south/calm me down was me saying “I wanna kill myself” “I don’t deserve this planet” “I’m such a bitch” sound weird, right? Anyone else have this happen?	1

"I’m going to start making arrangements for suicide tomorrow.My city looks like it will be going into lockdown again soon, and my mental health suffered so much from the first one that I cannot do another lockdown. This was mainly because I was stood down from my job with no certainty regarding if or when I would return. I spent nearly two months in a constant state of anxiety and fear.

Ultimately, I got my job back and got additional work at another workplace after working my arse off. However, I don’t know if I will get my job back the second time around. I’m only a casual worker, not an unsackable boomer in a salaried job who has the luxury of working from home.

I have suffered enough and deserve better for my efforts over the years. If all I have to look forward to is a dystopian police state, then I refuse to live in it.

I will buy some rope tomorrow so that I will be ready to hang myself if another lockdown occurs and I am out of work again."	1

"I can’t be arsed lnowso I have been suffering with depression for around 10~11 months, well I say that but I believe it to be closer to 5 years but I only want to say what I know and I know that I realised I had depression then. I have never been tested for it because I really don’t want the fuss and besides the medication doesn’t work, my mum was on fluoxetine which is an anti depressant and on the 18 th of february she slit her wrists knowing I was in the house but I have wrote about that before and I do not think I removed it so feel free to read it. I moved from my old school in nottingham to fucking cumbria (and no I am not that prick who is running for the youth council he is just some other guy from nottingham). cumbria is a shithole county full of shitty people who lead shitty lives and have shitty kids to contribute shit all to the shitty society but to be honest I don’t care about that, I just miss having friends irl. I made friends with a really nice girl from florida and we talk almost every day but due to the fact that it’s like 5 hours behind when I want to talk she is usually asleep or at school. I had 4 really good friends on csgo and we often played all through the day and night when I lived in nottingham but now I can’t even talk to them cause I have shit internet which has a data limit cause bt are cunts and don’t have a 6 month contract which we could have taken up for this house (a rental cause our house isn’t even fucking done yet).

I went to my councillor at school once after what happened but that was bullshit and she didn’t help. I didn’t feel comfortable sharing information about what I felt in case I was seen as a risk to myself and got sent to a mad house. I don’t want to go to a mad house cause I am not mad, i fact I believe myself to be the sanest person I know most of the time.

over the past month it seems like my life has been flipped upside down which has made all the shit that wasn’t boxed away in some distant part of my head spill everywhere. This couldn’t have came at a worse time this academic year as I am taking my mock exams for next years GCSE’s and when I am sat in the silent room I can’t stop thinking about what happened, replaying it over and over in my head. I usually do well in exams getting 9’s in science, 8’s in maths and computer science and 7’s in the rest (apart from french because french is the root of pure evil) but in these exams I don’t think I did well. I revised really hard for my maths exam but I don’t think I did well, I am close to being moved down to second set and if I do then I will be average at everything. I am gifted with chemistry and physics, well I assume so due to me getting better then the old A*’s a year early, but I am in a shit set and no teacher will move me. I feel afraid that if I fail these exams I will end up doing something stupid, I was gunna OD on my mums pills but I found out that they don’t work very well so that’s out the window. I just don’t know what to do, I just want everything to be over, I am nice to people and mind my own business and don’t try to be funny and just try to seem like a nice enough person to be friends with but it seems like it doesn’t work but I don’t want to change because then I would become that which I hate, people who try to be funny and seem funny but end up acting like cunts.

thanks for reading if anyone did, I don’t know if it will help but what else is there to do. if you can give me some advice which isn’t tell your parents I would appreciate it."	1

"Don't know what to doOver the past week my mind has been in turmoil, I just can't seem to shake the idea that I would be so much better off not existing. I don't sleep because my mind is so active trying to think of the best way to kill myself, and when I manage to get a bit of sleep my dreams are all horribly violent scenes of my death. 
I keep wanting to talk to someone but I know I'm a burden to everyone around me so there's no way they'd want to hear what I have to say. Every day I have to force myself to get out of bed and go about the day but my thoughts leech into everything I do.

No one cares about me. I just want to stop existing.I’ve been crying in my dark room for 6 hours. I haven’t eaten anything for a day. I’m not even home alone.

We don’t talk and I don’t feel I can connect with them. I don’t have any friends I feel I can talk to about my depression and it feels incredibly lonely. I’ve been contemplating suicide each day. I know exactly how to do it pain free and I know I would succeed. I feel it’s only a matter of when I’m gonna snap and finally do it.	1

I just feel there is no reason anymore... I feel like I am  stuck in a dark room with no way out. I see nothing in the future for me, at all. I cannot even handle the little piece of reality that my teenage life deals to me.  I have been through therapy, on medication, but nothing is helping. I just want to curling into a ball and fall asleep, never waking up again.  My friends don't understand how bad my depression is getting, and they have no idea how to deal with it.  I can't go to my parents.  I feel too bad for all I put them through already in the past year.  They did not ask for a child like me, full of problems and mental issues.  My brother is the perfect child, why can't I be like that?  No one wants me. I'm useless.  So why should I take up space on this Earth, while others are dying and want to live? I don't deserve life, so I'm giving back this gift.	1

"Gonna be dead by daylight (▰˘︵˘▰)No one
No one will care
No one will notice
No one will remember
No one will bother

And I will be
Done
Done with annoying everyone
Done with being a bad student
Done with causing trouble
Done with hurting so bad on the inside
Done with cutting myself until I get dizzy
Done with crying myself into sleep every night
Done with wishing myself to die every second...

Because then
My wish comes true
My over the years best kept wish
My most inner wish I remind myself every second 

And finally
I am dead

Dead forever
In the dark eternity
Of nothing"	1

"What could I do?Hi, everyone, thanks for clicking on this link. I'm a nihilist as you may have seen on my name
I've thought about killing myself a lot of times lately, I know that life is pointless, every human being is just dictated by its conservation and survival instincts as well as their personal pleasure, I know that killing myself would be painless as I know some fast and good methods. I also don't care much about what impact it would have on my friends, family and society as I won't be there to regret anything (I don't believe in gods or afterworlds, to me these are just stuff that humans invented because they couldn't believe that we are pointless and just a complete coincidence)
I was wondering what could I do before I decide to take my final step towards death, I am ready to die anytime, it doesn't matter a lot to me anyway but I'd like to have a little fun before that happens.
I've been watching a lot of anime, playing some video games and making stuff lately, however, I feel like I haven't experienced something that make people want to stay alive longer
I've already kissed a girl but I never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex, I failed my last two trimesters at school, I could get good grades if I worked a lot but I feel like it's not worth it, I feel like if I work hard or not, it won't change anything, I'm still going to die, I just want to have fun, to do what I want but there is no way I could live by doing the things I want.
So, can you think of anything I could do before I kill myself? (except watching dank memes all day, I've already done that)"	1

"I’m trying so hardYesterday I said I was going to kill myself over a F on my assignment. My boyfriend just ignored me.

Today, he got angry with me for making a joke that I’d leave him for Ellen page. He said, as revenge, that he’d leAve me for his ex. As a joke. Then he did his usual of going to bed.

I’m trying so hard to make everybody happy. I’m trying to get through college, I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want because I knew nobody else would appreciate me if I didn’t. Everything I do is to make everybody else happy, and I’m sick of it.

I’m 24, I live with my parents, I’m not able to find a job, and as of ten minutes ago I’m single. I’ve been in college for the past six years, with no luck on enjoying, let alone passing, a course. I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want to have because my boyfriend wanted me to. Throughout the first one, he was constantly telling me to leave him alone. I was constantly depressed for three months after, and he would always tell me to leave if I was going to act like that. The second one, he didn’t do that as much, but I wasn’t as depressed. I guess I was just used to it.

I think I’m ready to leave now. After he said he’d leave me for his ex I just thought... I’ve never thought to joke about that, I’ve never thought of leaving him for my ex, how can he sit there and joke like that if it isn’t true? 

So I think I’m done. I’m done trying. I’ve tried for thirteen years to get better and I’m tired. I can’t handle a job. I can’t handle school. I can’t even handle my boyfriend who I’ve been with for nearly six years. 

I can’t do it anymore."	1
"I'm a 17 year old senior and I sometimes feel like dying.This is my first time on reddit, so I apologize for any mistakes. 

My standardized testing results has been the lowest of my class and my mathematics skills is not even ""college or career ready."" My friends are usually too busy listening to music to talk and when they are not, they don't want to listen. I feel like a disappointment to my Dad. He wanted me to be better than he was, but I'm not. In March, I will be graduating and will begin my adult life. I have no idea what I want to do. Finally, I felt that my parents are older and in their late 50's and deserve to retire in happiness. Not waste time with a burden like me. My older cousin who I miss very much passed a way a couple years ago. He drank too much alcohol and died, he couldn't escape his inner demons. I don't know if I can escape mine.

"How do you make your life feel interesting/fun enough to stick around for?I was a depressed teen with the usual angst bullshit but I got over that like most people but even though I'm not depressed in the sense of the word then nothing really excites me..

I go on hikes alone in the middle of the night without a cellphone when it's cold and snowing outside and do stuff like go sailing on a rubber boat in a storm to spice things up but even then I don't really feel alive and when I'm just sitting at the computer or at college I fantasize about killing myself alot

I think it's probably because I've always been very into fantasy and anything supernatural and now that I'm mature enough to realize that something like that is never going to happen to me and it's just going to be this boring routine for the rest of my life but just like it is in the summers, with work to replace college then it just feels so pointless and dull"	1

My mind is destroying itself. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I've been thinking more and more about killing myself and I don't know if there is anything worth living for as stupid as it sounds. Please. I am begging you. I just need some hope."	1
"Anybody else get really scared when you get close to ending your life?Occasionally I will have a night where I get beyond the normal wanting to die, where I feel so unbelievably hopeless that I legitimately feel like I will hurt myself badly. 

I remember one night I was cutting myself and I realized that there is absolutely nobody there to stop me and that made me more scared than I have ever been in my life."	1
What’s the point of continuing? We all eventually die right? No shame in taking yourself out to meet something that was gonna eventually happenI have a homie that killed himself almost 2 years ago now, if he did it, the big move, like 100% permanent move, like packed his bags and dipped out this earth, I think I can too.

chronic pain has taken overI have tried everything for my back problems and they are just going to get worst. I have talked to other places in reddit about relationship problems because of it, and they only told me I was making excuses to not feel better. I don't know anyone who want to willingly feel like this. I have tried ODing 3 times and that doesn't work like it does in the movies. I think the only way is by firearms. Relief of life by police. Pretty sure they will do me the honors if I make them feel threatened. Have had an awesome life up until now, whats the point of continuing in such a awful manner? Why torture myself for and unknown amount of time? 	1

I’m sorryI’m gonna keep this as short as possible.. I’m 14 and have  schizophrenia.. it’s very common in my family.. it’s undiagnosed because I’m too scared to tell my family about it because I know there just going to humiliate me.. I have all the symptoms and my dreams will warp into reality.. I’m not saying this is a reason to kill myself but it’s progressively getting worse and my memory is fading and I’m scared of what I’m going to become. I don’t even know if my friends are real because when i mention them to my family they say that they’ve never seen them when I previously introduced them... I feel like my life is fading away and I don’t know what is happening. I know this is a terrible reason to but I plan to do it tomorrow.. I don’t know if I’ll be able to remember this post, so if you’re reading this and you know who I am based on my username I’m sorry this is the reason why I did it... good bye I love you all	1

It’s like I don’t exist. I feel little to no pleasure in this life aside from certain moments of eating. Even that has been ruined by my constant disgust of my body and face. It’s like nothing I do matters. When I close my eyes after this, I am at peace. I don’t have to think about my closeted sexuality, my looks, my family, nothing. I am truly pathetic. My coming days look the same. When can I just bom	1
One of the most satisfying things is seeing a genuine feminist It’s so nice to see a feminist who believes everyone is equal but doesn’t think all men are racists and bad. I mean I know there are lots of good feminist but all the ones you see in the front pages of social media seem to be saying that all men are nasty rapists who only think about sex. It just annoys me so much when you see the bad feminists that think women are superior like the people on r/thefairersex . I just want to say if you are a person who believes in gender equality (which is most people I think) you are a good person.	2

"Sexually dysfunctionalI have failed, over and over again, to have sex.  I can't seem to broadcoast to the guys in my life to stop hitting on me.  He said I asked for it.  I told him not to touch me.  I couldn't stop it from happening again.  How do I make them stop?  I don't want it, I tell them I don't want it, but they won't stop groping and touching and grabbing.  

Last time a guy hit on me, I jumped out of a moving cab. My face is fucked up.  I will literally shoot myself in the face, I can't figure out how to make this stop.  WHY WON'T MEN STOP.  I DON'T WANT IT I BEGGED HIM NOT TO THEY KEEP TOUCHING ME.

I'm dying insideLast week I tied a rope around my neck, and decided I would end my life that way. The week keeps going on and I keep making family members angry because I refuse to leave the house or do something, and I just want to scream at them to leave me alone.

I'm dead weight in this world.	1
"I messed up my life twice, might as well end itIt all started last year when I got into college. Took an engineering program and it went well till I just addicted into playing video games. This messed up my studies and by second semester I failed. 

I told my parents engineering wasn't for me and I went with architecture ( I actually enjoy the drafting part). But not even first semester I'm already falling apart. I felt so depressed and destroyed that I don't know what to tell my family and relatives. 

The only thing that's keeping me alive right now is that it's almost Christmas and I don't want them to have a depressing Christmas Day. Also my mom and dad is in a different country and I never seen them for almost a year. The thought of my family losing me through suicide is something I also can't imagine to think.

Right now I'm only waiting for after Christmas to end my life and a way to do it painlessly. Also probably to talk to some of my friends I never talk to in a little while."	1

His parents were either gone, or not liking him. I.e. their distrust in him when he says Vicky is rude to him. They also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him. His only teacher quite literally was insane. Not only that, this teacher had a profound disliking for Timmy. He’s also bullied in school, both by his “friends” and the person the show actually identifies as a bully. Lastly, the person who does take care of him most of the time, Vicky, is quite possibly a psychopath. 

It gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies. These fairies can solve every problem Timmy has, it’s everything Timmy has ever *dreamed* of. Sometimes things get so bad, they take him to another world (that fairy world thing) They quite literally blind him from his dark reality, as they bring him to another dimension, make him a superhero, get rid of his bullies, give him a girlfriend, all the things he could *imagine* they brought to him. 

Did you ever think that maybe the reason he can’t show Cosmo and Wanda to other people, isn’t because they would be taken away, but because they don’t exist? Think about it, his parents, his teacher, everyone constantly gives him weird looks, treats him like he’s lost it, treats him like he’s a “not all there” 5 year old. Maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much, isn’t because he just doesn’t like them, but because the “fairies” Timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he doesn’t try in school. 

Toward the end of the show, his parents get him a dog. Now, if you’re the parent to a 13 year old you’re not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own. You’d only get them a dog if the child ABSOLUTELY needs it. In Timmy’s case, the dog is likely just a therapy dog, who the parents got for Timmy thinking it could help him return to reality. 

I’m never going to be able to watch another Fairly Oddparents episode again. I tried it earlier, I was literally crying 5 minutes in."	2
This isnt about stop suffering..People aay that suicidal people wants to stop suffering instead of ceasing to exist.. i dont think thats my case.. i dont even know if i want to be happy.. i dont know if im capable of enjoying happiness.. i simply want to die.. i dont want to deal with life.. good days arent worth it.. im sick of this.. i have come to a point were i dont even care what kind of death awaits me.. i dont care if its slow and painful.. i just want to die.. i dont care if i get a terminal illness.. or someone kidnaps me and tortures me until fially killing me.. i dont give a fuck.. i want to die..	1
Anyone wanna talk?I just need some to chat with. Lost the love of my life plus a slew of other problems (family, work etc)	1
"How can I get over other people's opinion ? The only thing that keeps me from committing suicide is others' opinion about me !I want to commit suicide for various reasons:
 
  1. I'm in Medical school which I hate. Do not tell me ""it's going to get better"" - It won't ( and either way, I've run out of patience to wait for it ). Do not tell me ""you can choose something else"" - I can't, I invested time and energy into this and I am no good at anything else ( and I'm not brilliant at this either, so fuck it ). 

  2. I had an arguing with my parents. I know damn well that being 23 years old and living with them is a shame, but they just make me to feel even worse about it, even though they know I can't move out, because I have no money. Yeah, I could take out a loan and then spend the rest of my life working like a mad horse to pay back the loan. Thanks,  but no thanks. If this is life, I'd rather be dead and end up in I don't-give-a-fuck-where, whether hell does exist or not, I just don't give a damn, this crap is not worth living. 

  3. I didn't have a great adolescence at all. The first part of it was spend being a perfectionist, emotionally liable pathetic creature that I was, struggling to do well in school, because this was the only thing that mattered to my mom, plus struggling with my eating disorders all the time. The second part of it was me rebelling against my fucked-up family life: abusing alcohol and hanging out with other fucked-up people like me. Fast-forward and I'm 23, being in Medical school, studying things that I don't like, which is not a surprise, because for whatever reason I can't enjoy anything in my life at all anymore ( probably my brain is already fucked because of years of abuse ). 

  So there it is: I don't want to be a burden for my parents anymore and I can't think of anything else to figure out the shit I'm in and I've tried a lot of things. I tried working out, I was a gym member for 4 fucking years, you know what I got ? Even more body-image issues. 

  Also there is nothing motivating about the future either: in this world it's all about making good connections and licking people's asses, this is how you get ahead and so what's the point of it ? What's the point of this whole life , if I don't like anything at all about it anymore ?  I don't like the way things work, I don't like how this whole fucking world works, and because I know I'm not going to be the one who is going to change the world, I might just as well check-out, because I really don't want to fit in this society.

  I want to commit suicide, I just don't want to think about what other people will think after I die. It's kind of ironic, but this is the only thing that is holding me back. These idiots are going to talk about me even after I'm dead and I can't stand the idea of it. So tell me, if you are an average, normal person: how much people gossip about someone after they die ? What things they say about them ? Do they consider them cowards ? "	1
"The Last Drop - A Short Story      It was a Friday Afternoon, and the sun began to set.

     I had let my lawn mover and leaf blower begin to fully rest.

     I had tended to my lawn after feeling fully accomplished.

     But little did I know there was a urge my body hadn’t abolished.

     While I thought I was given time to relax...

     My bladder had something, to extract.

     With the sudden urge to release this fluid...

    I ran to the lavatory with no genders excluded.

     After reaching the bathroom, I shut the door behind me.

     I pulled down my pants, all the way past my hiney.

     I relieved myself in a clear-yellowish like stream.

     So comforting and fresh, just like in a midnight’s dream.

     As I finished It all up fashionably.

     I went up, down, left, right, and diagonally.

     I shook it all off with the thought of it to stop.

     But little did I know... it was not the last drop."	2
at least one of you guys knows me thats a scary thought	2
Is there anyone who can talk to me? I really would appreciate it... I’ve been having a rough day and all my friends are busy... I would really appreciate someone taking their time and messaging me...	2
It feels like I have no purpose in livingI feel like my life has lost all meaning, and while I have purpose within my family and friends, I don’t believe that it’s worth it to stay if I have no reasons of my own. The only reason I can’t do anything is the guilt I would have in hurting my family and friends, but in the end, I feel like I am empty inside. The days are passing so quickly and it feels like I am wasting my time on Earth dying slowly, so might as well get it over with for the sake of time. I wish I could stop feeling this way, but it has been so long with no change, and I just don’t know how much longer I can hold out feeling so low and meaningless.	1
"Veteran cousin in trouble. Suicidal and alcoholic at the end of his 5 day binge. Need adviceI'm at the VA right now trying to get my veteran cousin help. He's suicidal and needs to detox from a 5 day liquor binger.

 They will charge him for service since he has a ""less than honorable"" discharge for 2 dui's and no follow up care (""if we can even get a Dr. Down today). We are at the city hospital for emergency psych and detox screening waiting to check in now. 

He said he doesn't want to hurt anyone but himself. Any advice, suggestions or resources that will help would be great. He's currently in a halfway house for veterans and has employment but is seasonally unemployed. Marines if that helps with advice..."	1

Losing myself and scared for my kidI’ve been battling suicidal depression since 6 years old. I first tried and hanging myself at 7 and my dad caught me just in time after I had already lost consciousness. Then again at 10 by taking all of my adhd medication at once. I’ve had several more failed attempts. It’s not that I want to die but it feels right to me. I have a 3 year old boy and I know that I need to be there for him but I’m at the point of no longer caring who it affects or how. I don’t know why I’m feeling like this and it’s a little off putting. I can look at my kid hold or touch him. I always have to tell him everything will be okay when I know it may not be. I have it all planned and ready to go. I have lost everyone who was close to me and I try to reach out but everyone is just annoyed with me trying to vent. I am ready for everything to be over. I don’t want to leave my son fatherless but I know I am replaceable. I can’t tell his mom because I want to treasure the moments I have left with him. I’m only 25 but I know I won’t make it past 30. Everyone says it gets better but what about fighting this urge for 19 years. It has never once gotten any easier. I have tried counseling but it does no good. I’m right at my breaking point.	1
"can you tell me at all why this is a life worth living loli am constantly physically and emotionally abused, constantly heart broken, constantly in pain, constantly failing and there is no foreseeable out other than death 

my uncle just committed suicide last week and my initial thought was that it should have been me. this is not the first or last suicide in my family. i hate this existence"	1
i don't know.I don't know if this is the right place to ask but I need to know. I'm sorry if it is not. I have 14 oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-425 pills (some are smaller), 28 bupropion pills, 12 venlafaxine. Would that kill me? 	1
Cry for help (lengthy)My first post on Reddit; don’t really use reddit that much but I might now. This post is basically asking for any advice I can get on curing depression and wanting to end my life. As a child I was happy and was happy until the beginning of High school, it’s been a year since I graduated high school and it has only gotten worse through the years. I have only 1 friend that truly cares about me and the rest couldn’t care less had I died, I’m poor, I’m ugly, I’ve never been wanted by women after elementary school, I like to think that I’m smart but deep down I know I’m below average in intelligence and like to play it off as laziness for not getting good grades in high school. I can’t seem to keep a job, I feel anxious 24/7 and it’s only getting worse. I don’t know what my purpose is in life and I want to find out. I want to be a musician but I don’t have a single ounce of talent in my bones for anything. I just want to somehow eternally sleep forever without actually committing suicide because of how much a pussy I am. Only thing that keeps me alive is the recently slain rapper XXXTentacion, X for short. Now idk if he’s also despised in this area of the internet but his music gave me life especially the song “Heart Eater” if you were ever interested. I have a boring personality and just a dull person to be around with, with 0 charisma. I cry myself to sleep atleast twice a month wishing I don’t wake up the next morning. I just want to end it all before I reach the age of 20 but I’m too scared. If you’re still reading this; thank you and I’m sorry if you feel like this also. I wouldn’t wish this pain on my worst enemy but it’s the way it occurred in life.	1

"I'm freaking the fuck out. I can't function as an adult.not that I could function as a kid either, but as I'm becoming older my weirdness is becoming more and more of a problem. 

I'll just quickly say that I developed social phobia in the 7th grade. Since I shied away from everyone, I had no friends (besides my brother's friends who were only my friends because of my brother) all the way through high school. I get to college and run into the same problems. I never admitted it to myself until recently, but I've had severe depression/apathy for a very long time.

I no longer have social phobia, but I can't bring myself to show my personality. I've shown less and less of my personality as the years have gone by to the point that I'm now a complete fucking weirdo. And this isn't just around strangers and acquaintances I'm talking about; this is around my own brother and my cousin who is basically my sister. I can't be myself or show myself to anyone. I've recently tried 'practicing' by myself and trying to figure who I fucking am anymore and I don't like what I see and hear.

I took shrooms about two weeks ago and now instead of bottling everything away in pure apathy, I now care like a normal person. And I just want to die...even though I of course don't actually want to die. I want to be happy and comfortable being myself around people, but since I can't do that and will never be able, I want to die.

And I'm freaking out. I constantly have this terrible feeling in my stomach like I'm about to give a speech to a crowd of over 1000 people (and just giving a short presentation in class is one of my least favorite things in the world)... and it won't go away.

How can I come out of this?"	1

"What am I in store for? Concerned parent here. Hey everyone, I figured this would be a good place to ask so here goes. I am a 39-year-old father of a 13-year-old daughter who currently lives in Atlanta, while I reside in Philadelphia. To be honest, I wasn't there for 12 years and we recently reconnected and have been talking on Facebook. She came up to visit and it blew my mind how pretty she is and how cool she is at such a young age. I know I wasn't there for her as a father for 12 years but I have a second chance and I'm not going to blow it. And I know I'm lucky that she even talks to me.

My question is this, she just became a teenager recently, and she is starting seventh-grade in the fall. What do I have to look forward to as far as angst, depression, acting out, sexual experimentation, hostile behavior, etc.? I have a 22-year-old son, but I know what it was like to be a teenage boy. Teenage girls is unfamiliar territory.

I love my daughter, and lucky to have her in my life, I don't want to blow it, what can I do to be there for her? Lucky to have such cool kids and just trying to be a better dad. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks everybody, Ron from Philly."	2
"Today is my 20th birthday.Everyone in my life hates me. My dad felt annoyed when I reminded him, my sister will spend today elsewhere. I’m sick with what could possibly be covid, none of my old friends will text me because we fought and they rightfully hate me. I just wanted my own special day. I’m really a grown woman now. Theoretically. 

I was waiting for today though. Finally I have nothing to look forward to lmao."	1

"Been at the psych ward for 3 weeks and tmrw I go back to school and pretend nothing happened :’) kinda scared ngl anyone got any advice? Going back to school for first time in 3 weeks tmrw and just f e a r idk how to interact with real ppl anymore like actual ppl. Like in the psych ward everyone truly understood each other there was no stigma about self harm or suicide and u could talk about it freely and no one would mind. There you didn’t have to pretend you were ok. 

So tmrw i gotta go to school put on a smile and pretend I’ve been sick with a bad cold or smth and not in a psych ward for attempting sewerslide and just yeah.

I have a Discord server with two nitro boosts, roles, channels etc. I don't need it anymore so dm me if interested with an offer. The discord server is a hangout chat. This is a really good server for someone who isn't familiar with managing a discord server because everything is already set up (and I can help edit to your liking/theme). Even if you do know how to manage a server, it's still nice because of the two nitro boosts that grant additional perks. I'm willing to make a trade with something close to equal value that I can access online.	2
"Just can't let goI wanna start off by saying that i never really had this type of ""very close"" person in my life other than my mother. She thinks that meds will help in every single problem and i really do love her to death, but she truly is not helping at this point. And i know that for a fact.  (So let's get into this)   So i met this beautiful person like couple months ago, and we became so close. And i honestly felt like she was really the one i could always lean on, and talk to. But then things got different and we started fighting constantly, of course it made me sad that it might just end like this and it did. But then i started to accept the fact that she is now gone and that it would be better off that way. However these last couple of days have been sad, awful. It's like i'm trying to do things that make me happy but nothing helps. it's like i'm trying to forget her and her narcissistic personality. *Yes i truly mean that*, but in some weird way i really do miss her a lot, but i don't want to go back to that life, where she would be a part of my life. Reading this stuff that i wrote, and i know some of you might find this ridiculous/odd. But it really is a strange feeling. :/ Any help is truly appreciated. &lt;3"	1

"Want to be done with the pain, but don't want to hurt others, and I fear what does / doesn't come next!The title is pretty self explanatory. I have a life that on the outside looks good. Good job. Good family etc... however, it is like a piece of wood that has rotted on the inside and is infested with maggots and termites. 

I have been battling depression and anxiety for years now. I have pissed away a lot of money to make myself happy, but they are only momentary reprieves. 

Honestly, I just want to drive my car to a very wooded and secluded area, take a walk down a long path. Leave said path and find a beautiful spot, and put my pistol to my temple and blow my brains out. Suicide notes and all in my pocket, or in my car. 

However, I don't want to hurt my family, friends, and so and so forth. My best friend committed alcohol induced suicide 4 years ago this past St. Paddy's Day. And it devastated his family, and his friends, and I had to be the barer of bad news to a lot of people because his family couldn't do it right away. I just can't do that to my family, even though they are a large part of my stress and depression. My friends aren't for the most part. I mean I just want this to be over. But I also am afraid of what comes or doesn't come next, and if I am doomed to a worse fate. So for now I won't pull the proverbial and literal trigger. But man I want to. "	1

"I can't do it. Please help.I, honestly, genuinely want to die. The reason? Life's just lost its colors, it's gotten stale. There might be more to it but I'm too tired to even ponder it. There definitely used to be more though. The closest I've gotten to doing ""it"" was to dance on the train tracks, but I only ended up with a slightly bloody hand and embarrassment. I feel like I'm bothering people and I have friends with real depression. I'd feel disrespectful to talk to them about my fake shit. 



A friend talked me out of it once, but I'm too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I'm not fine this time. I don't want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring. I mean, if others do it, that's okay. They deserve help.



If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago, I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it, but didn't want to do it. Now I have no reason to wish it, but I want it more than ever. This is why I can't even ask for help... I have nothing to say. Well, aside from school. That's probably one of the main reasons, but it's so insignificant and selfish that I'd be a hypocrite to talk to others about it like it was a huge deal, because it shouldn't be. But it really is. Still, if I don't want help, I want the easy way out.



I guess I have walking depression, but I can still laugh and smile all day. The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife: if it exists, I go to hell and I'm fucked. If it doesn't exist, I just wasted what isn't even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void. I don't feel sad, but I don't want to live either. If you gave me a gun a week ago, I would have pulled the trigger. I don't know if my friends still like me, I'm probably annoying. 



I just want some words of peace, something that can give me courage and convince me to do it, I guess. This is the only related sub I know, although it's the opposite of what I want. Thank you &lt;3"	1

Please grant me the death I seekNo one on this earth wants me. I want love.  I don't want to go on anymore. But I'm too scared to actually commit to killing myself. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't. And my brain keeps telling me, 'what if'. I just want to be dead. People who die are so lucky. They are. I was watching a tv show episode. And in that episode, this girl was about to get killed. But then she realised she didn't want to try to survive. That her death means release, it means peace. And the person who was about to kill her sensed this and gave her a peaceful death. I want someone to do that to me. To at least give me a painless, peaceful end. She is so lucky. I want my release. So then I'll be free.	1
"Anyone who says California should fix its pollution problem clearly doesn’t understand how wind works The Midwest needs to fix our problem, cuz what happens is a coal power plant or anything else in Nebraska or anywhere else West of the Mississippi pollutes the air, than that air gets blown by wind into one of California’s many valleys where it gets trapped, thus causing the worst air quality in the country

"hanging in there for too longI made some mistakes, and managed to run from the consequences. I ran because I was afraid, afraid of what would happen, afraid of what I would lose. Now I am afraid of what it would do to people I care about. Every time in the past few years I've gotten down enough to contemplate suicide, I've taken steps to deal with the consequences. And every time a new milestone I set to fix everything is passed, I realize how little effect it had, I'm no better off than I was before.

I'm living a triple life. I never tell anyone everything, so at best the people closest to me only have a partial view of what is going on. But I can't do it to them to tell them, that is unacceptable. I will not tolerate the loss, nor would I manipulate the loss away. I refuse to.

But yeah, now my last ditch effort is holding thumbs for the next two hours or so. If things work out, then maybe I will make it through this month, but only to have to face problems next month. Next month's already going to be harder.

If things don't work out. Well, I don't know yet. It's not like I'm going to kill myself, that takes planning and resources I just can't afford right now.

"I have been alone my entire life. Never had a single person I felt close to. What is it like to care?I am going to be 30 in a few months. They made a movie called the 30 year old virgin, but I am even sad compared to that. I haven't even held onto a girls hand walking down the street. I have no clue what it feels like to have someone love me. I could give up all my money and possessions to live on the streets and be happy as long as I had someone by my side, but I will never have that. I am just working so I can eat when I am able to. I am so depressed that I force myself to eat once a day, sometimes every other day.

I did meet someone this year that I thought hey maybe she might like me. She was a kind single mother of two. I helped her out when I could. Things like her car broke down so I drove two hours to fix it. When it died i bought a PT cruiser that was in rough shape from a buddy, I spent 2 months fixing it up for her.... Well anyway none of that matters. Now she is with someone else. I am yet again forgotten. 

I am working to eat, so that I can die a slow painful death. I have been burned, stabbed, thrown, and injured many ways in my life. But nothing hurts more than this loneliness. I would give anything, do anything to have someone in my life.

I don't know what I expect from this. Guess I am just hoping I am wrong and there is someone out there reading this. I can't go on like this."	1

"Never happyI used to be so happy when I was a child in school. My imagination was so big that I forgot everything else along with my bestfriend during that time. But time changed as I got older... I woke up when I was around 12 years old. It was all about girls, education and success all of sudden and I didnt understand it. I began feeling unhappy and have been it ever since. Im 21 btw. I was always the ""clown"" who made all my friends laugh and I laughed myself on the outside. But inside I was crying... I felt alone and unhappy. I had friends and a bestfriend yes. But I was still completely alone once I walked home to my house playing video games. When I got older I began loosing my friends and became more an outsider in my school. They invited me to parties but I began making lies to skip it and so I spend so many weekends alone.  *I have missed out on so many epic parties,* I have missed out so many epic parties and experiences because of my shyness and lies. As I went to highschool it got worse. I only saw my classmates in school and to a few parties. I was still the funny guy though but that was all. During senior some in my class begin making fun of me for never having talked to a girl before. I just laughed with them. But deep inside it was another knife to my heart of all the failures I have made. I realised I will never get to experience what my friends experienced. The normal social life, always spending time with the guys, going out and hooking girls. After I graduated I lost all contact with them cuz I skipped them. Im an selfish asshole and that have destroyed my life.

Now I am on the edge of suicide. I dont fit in this world. I make jokes of everything and make people laugh. But the only person who doesnt laugh is myself. Where is the joy? Where is my succes? Where is my happiness?  

But I have accepted reality and find that hope was only a peaceful illusion.... Now acceptance, still lost and no idea where next... Am I happy? Never. That's just another illusion, I'm conscious of reality....for now, that's enough but not for long..... "	1

I guess this started about a year ago when I had my first panic attack at 16. It was horrible, and I've never really recover from that and I've been constantly in a downwards spiral. My anxiety is constant throughout the day, for all that time, never truly giving me a break. Sometimes its manageable when I'm in the my room during the daytime, but anywhere else it's a fucking painful cancer. Even things like movies and themeparks make me want to cry and puke from anxiety. Sometimes I get lucky and I get a couple minutes burst of endorphins, but those are quick and only put the anxiety in the background. Everything is just so difficult to do now.

This anxiety has caused worse and worse mental health. My memory and focus is completely shot because I can't sleep at night (typing this at 3 A.m). I can't even get to sleep unless there's sunlight coming in, causing me to be in a vicious cycle of sleeping from 4 A.M to 12 P.M. I've tried so much to get me back to normal but my body simply will not cooperate. If I go to bed at 9 P.M I'll wake up a hour later in a sweat and bursting with energy I can't use.. It's exhausting and I had it. I just want to have a normal sleeping pattern of 11 P.M- 8 A.M.

My appetite is out of control. I'm not hungry during the day and starving during the night. I hate it so fucking much. 

Over the past six months self-harm and suicidal thoughts are becoming worse. My day is bombarded with thoughts of hanging myself, throwing myself down the stairs, and chocking myself out. Now sometimes when I close my eyes I see a grotesque image. I'ts becoming more and more frequent.

I don't have any friends and I'm going insane from that. My parents are completely emotionally unavailable and useless. Every time I bring it up, I get stepped on ignored. They constantly keeping me on a leash, refusing to let me out of the house until they so decree. I don't even have a single fucking friend. How the hell does a fucking teenager now have any friend how the hell could some be that stupid jesus fucking christ. My only grace is I found a job and can get out of the house part-time. There's nobody around to help.

This is causing me so many problems. Every day feels exhausting and terrifying. Nothing feels real anymore. My emotions and thoughts are clashing like waves. My brain just won't fucking stop being so mean. I'm woozy and faintish whenever I stand up. I don't have motivation to game or write anymore, which I used to love. Everything just hurts me now.

I honestly just want to die and get this the hell over with, I just want rest. I just want everything to stop. I'm so fucking honestly and helpless and so far gone I don't know I would even want to live if I got better. This has been the worst year and my fucking life and hopefully the last. "	1
It's a sum of small thingsI don't know where to start or what to write. I would just like to talk to someone. I was doing so good but now I just want to die.	1

"School is starting soon, and I'm just dreading it... It's around a week until school and I'm just depressed. It's 2:37am. I tried sleeping but couldn't. I just can't stop worrying about school. My parents say if I prepare myself it'll be fine, but it never is. And it really hasn't been since around 5th grade. For about 5 years my social life has just been crumbling and I've slipped further and further into introversion and depressive thoughts as social anxiety grew. I know I shouldn't, but I hate myself for it. I hate myself for being so awkward around people. I hate being at school as it reminds me of how much I am pathetic at social interactions. Three more years of high school is daunting. What's after that... is terrifying. I swear, the only thing keeping me from completely losing my shit is music and reddit. I feel like I just want to give up on everything, but I know I shouldn't. How does one give themselves drive to keep going, have hope where hope is scarce?

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk"	2
My best friend tried to commit suicide, I feel so helpless. She did not succeed, and she is now getting help, but I feel like I need to do something for her. I didn't see it coming at all, but I just learned that it has also not been her first attempt. I am currently in another country from her, which is also frustrating. How do I act when I see her again? I want her to know she's loved without making her feel alienated. 	1
Living for the sake of othersDoes anybody feel like they're simply existing for the sake of their loved ones? I'm a male going on 21, a CS major at a decent college, and I've been very fortunate in life, both financially and socially.  However, since about sixth grade this has put up no fight to my depression.  Regardless of what I have, I'm unhappy.  That's not to say I'm not grateful, but this being the sub I'm posting to, I'm sure there are a few of you who get what I'm saying.  Every day I feel like I exert so much of my energy just living that I find insurmountable amounts of block when trying to do things (i.e., socializing or schoolwork).  My parents would just assume I'm lazy, and my depression has pushed me into a repetitive cycle of wanting to self indulge; this is not to ignore my problems but to see if the faintest amount of hope can be found in something I enjoy.  However, I feel there is no enjoyment I find in things I like(d).  I simply do them on repeat with no real emotional response to them.  I can't remember a day where I haven't thought about killing myself at this point, and I feel it's growing ever nearer.	1
Hi.Anyone willing to just talk?  I had this long post in mind, but decided against it.  Any sort of external messaging app would be nice.  I just need to talk with someone before I follow through... again...	1
Just OD'dBye.	1
no clickbaitSome days I wish I could just stop. It's started to become more then less. This is where I am. Churning down a hallway trying to work as hard as I can with the work I'm signed to do, but still not getting forward. It's deliriously tiring. Seeing people get promoted in front of me for doing jackshit or having an opportunity in front of me without actually being clever enough to do the job. It's all just tiring. It feels like I'm bathing in hellfire. Scratching through each piercing arrow. Happily conjoining with them, just do sear myself even more. I'm so tired and so fed up with the situation. I wish. I just wish somebody close to me knew what I feel. And I wish somebody could give me a push and an answer. I'm so fed up	1
Enough Is Enough. I'm sick and tired of this. Everyday science strives to be better and better. But they're has to be a stopping point. There has already been so many disasters as result from science, and this is no exception. Science has been so focused on whether they could have done something, that they never stopped to ask whether or not they should. -*Man's response on digiorno's croissant crust.*	2
"I feel myself lonely and trapped in this nightmareI feel like I have no one to talk to.. and I am too scared to call the police or any agency because of the things happening before.

Is there anyone here that can talk some sense in me?"	1
"Am I alone in feeling this way?Hi all. I joined reddit only to come here and reach out. I feel pretty lonely and I really just want to know if there are other people that have a similar experience. I am not actively suicidal or in danger to myself, but I've been struggling a lot. 

I'm a teenager, and it's been six weeks since I got discharged from a residential treatment program, and I've been having a really hard time. I've never had a ""real"" suicide attempt, but I've been depressed and anxious for a long time, and I've lived with suicidal ideation since I was 10. My family has been abusive in the past. I didn't realize this was the case until very late into my treatment at residential which has been very difficult because I came home with a lot of unresolved issues. 

I've been in every level of care, and because I was steadily declining, I was put into a residential treatment facility. I also needed 24 hour care due to how nonfunctional I was. When I got there I realized that most of my peers in the facility had attempted suicide. I have had suicidal actions, such as writing letters/notes, collecting pills, figuring out ways to end my life, starting to attempt, etc. Ever since I got into treatment, my resolve to actually attempt has gotten stronger and stronger. I'm very afraid that my pain isn't valid unless I've tried to kill myself. That narrative has been cycling through my mind for a few years, and now I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. 

There have been many, many times when I've been actively suicidal, or at least gotten to being ""truly suicidal"", meaning I really, really wanted to die. As in, that's all I wanted out of life. When I was residential I really wanted to kill myself and I tried 3 times, but none of them worked because I didn't have what I actually wanted to use, which was really frustrating at the time.

 The other odd thing I've realized is that I wasn't attempting outside of treatment because I lived by staying in bed all day, sleeping all day, or watching youtube all day. That meant I didn't have to actually think about why I was in pain, so I stayed in limbo of numbing the pain and constantly getting caught in it. I guess it was my only way of keeping my suffering at bay. But then when I actually had to think about the pain or why I was in pain, the suicidal thoughts became rampant. It also doesn't help that when I'm not suicidal or when I'm having a good day, that ""I'm not sick enough"" narrative is there. So when I'm actually actively suicidal where I want to die, that narrative adds even more resolve as to why I ""need"" to kill myself. 

But I'm afraid of being seen as wanting attention. That's the exact opposite of what I want. It's really hard to attempt at home because 1) I don't want my family to know 2) I don't want people to find out and worry 3) I don't want to get hospitalized again 4) I don't want to talk about with anyone, or talk about the emotions behind it. 

It's weird, because when I'm not actually suicidal, I'm thinking all the time about wanting to attempt suicide to prove I'm in pain, or that my pain is valid. But when I'm actually suicidal where I want to die to end the pain, then the ""you need to prove it"" just feels like an added reinforcer, even if that's not the primary reason I want to die. But then again, isn't it kind of fucked up that my baseline is ""I need to prove I'm in pain by risking my life and/or dying""?

I don't know, maybe I'm looking for reassurance, maybe I'm looking for someone to relate. It's odd. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this, and I haven't, so I'm still trying. I'm still reaching out. But it's just so hard.

I think I'm just sad and alone and exhausted."	1

"Went to school for the first time in 2 months today and my friends decided to try and go through my phone without my knowledge Not upset at the prospect but...

Recently I started dating my friend and it’s one of those cases where it looked obvious from the outside that we had a crush on each other.

Well today my girlfriend let it slip accidentally and it’s spread faster than fire and that led to some of my friends trying to go through my phone when I left it in my pocket for PE (physical education).

I don’t know what to do because these people make up like 70% of my friends and I’m scared because I have some private shit on my phone (nothing illegal but just shit you don’t want sharing).

The friends didn’t make it past the Lock Screen but I’m fucking scared they’ll do it again."	2

"Irreversible problemIn general I've had an alright life. I've got friends, I'm generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me, I have a supportive mother and family, I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm, fincally alright off and I had a loving, caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with, as did she.

Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life.

During our two year relationship she'd been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better.
The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times, but I stuck by her because she was worth it. 

Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I'd been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her. 

Since it happened everything has just spiralled. Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me. It's put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live. I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much.

The main thing above all else is how I've lost her and I can't fathom or face a life without her. She was just too special, too loving, too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her. I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would've happened had I just stayed.

I'm 32, I've spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity. It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted.

It's been over half a year since it happened and I'm just getting worse. Even with therapy, grief counselling, medication and endless research I'm not improving. I won't meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare. 

I don't really want to die but again, I can't face a reality without her. I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it, getting the confidence to do it. I get no joy from anything, I just cry and spend all day in bed. Not even sure why posting this, I guess it's just somewhere to vent. "	1
"Pity doesn’t helpI’m about to be admitted to the very hospital I currently work at (though obviously not for much longer). A lady there during orientation said her “heart goes out to suicide ideation patients because y’all there are some people that don’t think their life is worth living and that just hurts my heart for them” and my (internal) reaction being such a person without her realizing was “b— no one said your life was worth living either. I could have literally any life and I would still want to die.” Basically my point is pity is not helpful because we are not less than you. 
Aside from that it really sucks but it’s true even though my specific life is extremely difficult and hard to deal with I cannot imagine any possible life where I would be okay apart from maybe just inheriting a couple million dollars. (Not going to happen any time soon.) 
I can’t think of any job where I would be okay or any way of life where I would be okay. 
I had a meltdown at work Tuesday from severe anxiety and the sent me home for two weeks to sort it out. I have been home a week with no improvement. Tried to find a doctor but they said it will be at least a week and a half for my first app with a therapist and two weeks after that to see a psychiatrist. I don’t have a regular doctor and all the local doctors charge a $120 new patient fee on top of the appointment itself.   My husband says he will take me to commit myself tomorrow but my hospital triggers the anxiety and it’s the only good hospital there is so everything just suck and knowing from the backside they are just pitying me doesn’t help. Because what makes them think their life is so special compared to mine? Maybe some of us are just tired of suffering and not having any resources to help ease that."	1

"Is it normal to think about suicide every day?I've come close, and tried to overdose, but every day since then I've just seen different things as suicide methods. Anywhere from speeding cars, to high ledges, to my medication I always get the same ""It'd be so easy."" thought. Is this normal?

"I want to stab myself to death.My life hasn't be going good places at all lately. The only thoughts tracing my mind are how to kill myself and nothing more. I am apathetic and I do not feel anything but sadness and depression. Literally nothing. Every tiny laugh I made, every smile I tried to make, everything was fake. My parents never loved me, if I would take a shot for everytime they said ""You're useless"", ""I wish you would kill yourself"" and ""You are nothing"", I would've been already dead 5 times over. I don't have friends and I left my other ones after I moved into another city. Nothing kept me alive for the past 4 months but my own fucking cat, and even that doesn't help me anymore. None of my relationships ever worked, my last one was an LDR and I know such things never work out well for those that do not even have the money to visit the nearest country to them – let alone something that is located across the whole world from you. 

I feel nothing but sorrow, I hear nothing but insults and judgements, I am slowly descending into psychopathy and schizophrenia. I want to end myself. I want to overdose on every single pill there is in my kitchen, I want to stab myself at the side of my neck 5 times and choke on my own blood before dying, I want to tie a noose around my neck and finally jump. I want to feel happy again, and that's the only way of doing it. I want to fucking die, that's what brings me happiness."	1

"I wonder what I feel about this...a friend who doesn't 
care.Note: I have been in a depression for a long time. Opened up about it about a year ago. Saw almost all of my friends leave me, one by one when I wasn't useful anymore. I lost my job, got expelled from university for failing to write my final thesis and had to move back to my parents basement. I had one friend left, my best friend, or so I thought. She didn't stay in contact and neither did I much. I wrote two e-mails but that's that. I had hoped she'd care about me even when I wasn't around to do things for her. She didn't. When I hadn't heard from her in two months I wrote to her wishing her well for the future. I thought that it had ended and wanted to at least tell her that I am proud of her for having finished university and all. She replied that she had put her head in the sand instead of writing me and she was sorry. And then she asked if I had my degree and what I was doing now. And I...well...I kinda broke. I told her that I hadn't gotten my degree because, as I told her, I was kicked out. And that quite frankly I have nothing ""exciting to share"" because I was trying not to kill myself and it was pretty hard. I also replied that I knew that I didn't have much to offer in terms of conversations and that it was okay if she didn't want to reply.

And well she didn't. I don't know, I was probably too harsh to her and there is nothing she can do anyway. I am just a burden for everyone and why would she want to talk to me? It's just hard knowing that apart from your parents there isn't a single person who cares. I guess I am wondering if I should try to apologize, get her a present and ask her to forgive me because I really really owe it to my parents not to kill myself and it's just harder when you have no social network at all. That sounds so technical but yeah I sort of miss her, I mean I miss the times when I was still able to do things with her and for her and I know it's unfair to ask someone to be friends with you when you aren't doing anything for them.

I just don't really know. Maybe I am just writing here so somebody at leasts knows about me? I am sorry, this is horribly written and it's probably not the right site for this."	1

"I think my girlfriend's father is forcing her to leave me I'm afraid that my girlfriend(14) will leave me(m, just turned 17) because her father is against the relationship. I understand that the age difference is bigger than in an average relationship, he thinks that I'm only in it for the sex, that's not the case though. Whenever I'm with her I feel butterflies and when she smiles at me the world stands still, she makes me feel like the happiest guy alive and I genuinely care for her and don't want her to get hurt in any way, in case you're wondering she has told me that she feels the same way about me.

We were texting eachother when she pretty much disappeared for half a hour, when she came back she sent a snap of her hand bandaged up, she has had self harm issues before, just like me, a month or so earlier we swore to each other that we won't do it anymore for each other. I asked her what happened and she told me a bit unbelievable story.

Then she asked me when she wanted me to lose my virginity, to which I replied ""whenever you feel ready, making you do something you're not comfortable with is the last thing I want to do"". She then asked ""what if I won't be ready?"", I replied ""you'll know when you're ready"".

Then out of nowhere she texted me ""I know that would be a reason for you to leave me"", I replied that I would never leave her. She started telling me that she wouldn't fulfill my needs and I would need someone else. I told her that all I would ever want is just to be with her and that having sex is not the point of the relationship."	2

"A very tough lifeName's Michael, a youngling, 18, living in Costa Rica, University of Costa Rica Law School first year student. My father died recently. My father was my guide, my best friend, my mischievous buddy, we did everything together. He died of liver cancer on the hours between 11pm of Feb 12 and 1am Feb 13, I was woken up by my worried girlfriend (we were  in a call and was woken up by the same thing) and my mother screaming and pleading for mercy
I didn't have a chance to see my father when he was hospitalized up until the day of his death, mere hours before it happened. He was drugged, only way through stop his unrelenting rebellious spirit that prevented him from staying in bed. Only thing I could get to say was that I had finally entered into law school, his dream come true, he was so happy. He wanted to kiss me, but he couldn't, he was too high. I kissed him instead, and begged him to stay still. I promised him I'd tell him more once he was out of the hospital. He replied to me with a particular set of words in Spanish he would always say to me ""ok, Mijo"" high and not willing to let me go but still letting me go because he understood I was uncomfortable. How I wish I hadn't.
How I wish he was still alive, still with me, still smiling and talking to me about his job in the private air charter flights company he administrated
Life without him is so hard, it's almost not worth living

Almost.
I still cling onto my now ex girlfriend. She has BPD, and I myself am not at my 100% sanity levels. She still loves me, so she claims. But during two months past my father's death, I treated her badly. I would be cold and edgy, saying things like nothing mattered in the end not even her, seeking help from anyone and anything that'd be willing to help me feel better, this worsened our situation, and long story short, we broke up. After nearly a year of full commitment, and 7 months of nothing but what we both wanted, a relationship 100% us and no one else, we broke up. I hurt her to the point where her entire body and life tells her not to come back to me. She keeps saying she wants to be better and healthier before we date again, as she also has cancer. A little detail I didn't mention before, that holds some importance. I always tried my best to take care of her as much as I could, even in her darkest times. It seems as though it's an excuse to gwork on herself and become independent and forget about me though. I'm soon to be diagnosed with ADHD as my therapist said I met all criteria but prefered I went to a psychiatrist for a Dx. So maybe that plays a part in the way I see things, and I sure hope it is
But then again
Sometimes she'll come to me and give me all that love, and sometimes it just seems as though she's tired of even talking to me. 
My mother and other family members know me as the smart yet extremely quite kid. Not to make a joke and a stereotype about autism but, you know the kind. They expect so much from me, but I'm failing class, I'm failing my father, I failed to take care of him. My actions got him killed. I could've saved him.
My actions also ended a relationship both parties had invested tons into, and now I cling onto the idea that we will one day be back together, even though sometimes it seems like a straight off lie. But I've lost so much already, I've destroyed my entire life.
If she confirms my doubts and leaves, nothing will stop me from wanting to od, no matter how many things are pointed out, people that love me, things like that. Nothing works, I simply want out, and I don't know why I can't just feel okay again, this year has taken everything from me; even my will to live."	1

"I have so much to be thankful forDownvote please because I’m not actually suicidal. Not familiar with this subreddit but found it randomly and didn’t wanna freak out others. 

I just don’t know what I have to offer this world or vice versa. Emptiness. I’m nothing and stupid and alone. If America doesn’t ease into facism, it will explode into a civil war. None of my people have guns. Re: Climate. I live in California and things will only get worse (as will it everywhere.) Luckily I have no children, nor a partner— I have no stake in this game.

"To the guy that dm'd me asking if i am a girl and then immediately asked me to be his gf on behalf of all girls on this sub i can tell you that doing something like that doesn't get you a gf because 

1. it makes us feel very uncomfortable if you ask that, like you could have just started a nice convo, but no, you just had to start the convo asking if I'm a girl.

2. Most of us aren't that desperate for a bf, to just say yes

3. Some of us aren't even into guys

My parents found one of my suicide notes and brushed it off as a phase, this was the last strawI've had depression since I was 16 I parents never believed me they ridiculed me and brushed it off my dad was the biggest problem he made me feel worthless every weekend when he was home and every weekend I would add to my suicide note they found it and just brushed it off.	1
Nothing left to loseCurrently 5 years graduated BA with honors and still working a shit minimum wage paying job. I hate the situation I am in. I can't afford to live on my own, everyone I encounter is a complete piece of shit with their judgmental attitudes in this overly excessive affluent town I am surrounded by in my neighborhood which happens to be excluded from the city, despite living less than a mile away from the municipal building. What I am getting at is that this is America, I can buy a gun no problem whatsoever. I want to end my life. So why should I not take out those who have wronged me in the process? Nobody bats an eye over bloodshed of American lives over oil, so what's the difference? Help me understand why I shouldn't follow in the steps of our great government leaders.	1

Any one else like this Ok so last night I had a dream which is a very rare occurrence for me, but the dream was about a girl and I fell in love with the girl. This isn't the first time I've had this dream a couple of times before with the same girl but her eye, hair, and skin color changes. I've never seen her full face so I have no clue what she looks like,and we somehow always find each other even if the dream isn't about her, but I guess the dreams are real nice to have when I only dream once every blue moon.	2

"i’m weaki’m weak. i’m pathetic. i’m stupid, and ugly, and worthless. i tried going to a crisis center yesterday but got scared and got them to let me out. i shouldn’t have left.i want to die and i want this suffering to be over with but i keep going to therapy and work and perpetuating this horrible life i live. why. why why why. i don’t want to go to work, but i don’t want to be at home. i feel so alone. i did this to myself. i put off therapy too long and my ex didn’t want to wait any longer. i’m miserable without him. he’s not even gone. we still live together but he wants space and i’m so attached. i depend on him too much. i’m trying to bide time until therapy makes a difference and i can see a psychiatrist but it’s taking so long. waiting is so hard. i want to stop feeling this way. everything would be okay again if he took me back but i know he won’t. at least not right now. but when? i need to become a person again on my own. i know it. it’s just so hard to be alone with yourself when you hate yourself. i hate myself so much. he was so good to me. he was so amazing and i fucked it up. something so perfect and i couldn’t not fuck it up. i’m pathetic

i want to quit my job but i can’t i have to pay my bills so i can keep being alive and suffer and i’m tired of it. i’m tired of just working to pay bills to live a life i have no enjoyment in living. i don’t want this to be forever but it doesn’t feel like it’s going to get better. i’m so tired."	1
The only reason i’m having trouble killing myself is because I don’t want certain people to think it was their fault.I’ve experience the worst guilt possible and I can say that I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy, even if they were rude to me I still wouldn’t want them to possibly go through terrible guilt. Also I don’t want my friends to feel bad and like they could’ve done something to change my mind.	1

"Help others in your situation by sharing your story in a blogI work for My Me Mission Services LLC, a company dedicated to helping people overcome their insecurities and actualize their potential to become the best version of themselves possible - the ""Me"" the want to be.

My Me Mission Services LLC has always been a very personal company that helped individuals one-on-one to improve their lives. Lately, we've decided to open a blog in order to reach and help people on a much more grand scale.

Suicidal thoughts is a real problem that many people face. Over the last two years, we've helped dozens of suicidal men and women improve their lives and reduce their suicidal tendencies.

A huge component of the mentality of many suicidal people is the feeling that they are alone. Many feel that the problems they're dealing with are unique when most are very common. In order to show this, we would like to interview (formerly) suicidal men and women and share their stories in the Stories section of our blog. We not only want to help people know that they are not alone, we want to share real world examples of how others in their situation have curved those thoughts and improved their lives.

You can choose to make your identity confidential in the way you want. If you're in Las Vegas, we can interview you in person and you have the option to have your video interview posted.

Just send me a DM/PM and we can set something up.

Thank you."	1

"When everything is a struggleHow do people get through the day or week when all you can think about is the life you want and how out of reach it is but every day the thoughts come and over power everything. 
I've always been alone was bullied and sexually and physically abused in high school my parents never cared my dad beat me. I'm overweight and no matter what I do I can't lose weight. I'm stuck on a farm for another few months and everyday feels like a million years. Seeing people happy or talking about their good lives and relationships makes me even more depressed. I really don't want to die but I don't see how I can keep doing this with no relief in sight and no reason to be alive I wish I was just sedated all the time."	1
"I don’t want support. I just want someone to listen and acknowledge what I have to say.I’m a bad person. How am I so narcissistic but also at the same time such a self-deprecating piece of shit? I’m fat, unhygienic, unmanly and have a horrible personality.

Some people like me and call me their friend. I don’t know if their standards are super low or what, but I wish I had the heart to tell them how much I appreciate the fact they like me. I wish they would ignore me and go for better friends but at the same time, it feels like a knife going through my chest when I see them talk to other people, as if I’m selfish and need approval, even if it won’t do much.

I get jealous when I see the men around me. They’re confident and responsible. I was beaten a lot by my uncles as a kid. I can tell one of them feels remorse over his actions since he’s been too nice over the years, trying to buy me expensive things and whatever. 

The abuse ripped apart every inch of manhood I had. I wasn’t strong, I wasn’t dignified and I wasn’t brave. I’ve bonded more with my sisters than any other men I’ve met in my life. They understood the abuse as they had gone through it as well, however they could be a bit stoic at times. 

Because of the abuse, I’ve grown to not trust many people and be extremely anxious and shy 24/7. I hear my family members, schoolmates, etc talk about how I lack ambition, how I’m too reserved and feminine, how I’m not as good as the other kids. Sorry I can’t speak in a room full of people, sorry if my face flushes red when my name is called, sorry I feel more comfortable being alone for days than visiting some of the family but it’s your fault for sitting back there and supporting the abuse when I was younger. Every time I took one step too far, I’d be threatened as you thought it was a good way to control me.

My father died when I was 4 and I was vulnerable. Beating and threatening me with violence are the two things you should definitely not be doing... All those punches that were thrown, tears I’ve shedded and lashes from your belts were for no benefit. And even then, my father probably wouldn’t have treated me any nicer had he still been alive at that point. 

I’m the runt of the family now. I’m stupid, weak, shy and not manly enough. Why can’t I be more like my fucking doctor aunts or lawyer uncles?! I’d kill myself if I didn’t have two sisters and a few friends who care. I’m happy for my sisters, but their success still hurts... Good job graduating suma cum laude with a 4.0 GPA and degrees in mathematics and electrical engineering. I cried tears of joy because of how happy I was for you that night. If only I could make them as proud of me as you did."	1
"How do I tell my family that I don't want to live any more?It's all I can think about. I want euthanasia (legal in my country) so I can donate my organs and it won't be as unexpected as suicide for my family. I really hope I can find a doctor who will help me with that. Because I don't want to kill myself, but I will if it's the only way.

I suffer from depression if you're wondering, and yes I have tried therapy and drugs."	1
"Yep Dont even bother to read something posted by a worthless piece of shitNo body ever reads my posts . I just wanted ths to be out there before i bring an end to this miserable existence.

Like what the fuck man, Who in the fucking world said its going to be okay?  
HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO LVE SUCH A FUCKING MISERABLE LIFE ? 
I have given myself so many fucking chances hoping that it would get better but it never did.  Once you fell into the hole you can never get out.

What happens to outstanding debts like loans and credit card bills?Basically it's pretty simple.  I'm going to kill myself. I give up struggling every day, it's worn everyone in my life including me down.  I'm just curious, what happens to debts like a student loan or a credit card bill, that's specifically in my name.  My parents or any other family is not listed on any of the items. I don't want to leave them with any debts that will make them think of me anymore then needed.  If anyone has any advice I'd be interested in hearing it. 	1

Fucked up and need some help Got drunk last night and texted my crush (who’s also currently only beat friend) ranted to her a bit about no one wanting to talk to me, and her spending most of her break time msging her bf, then I called her amazing and said if she wasn’t dating someone I’d have asked her out but we’re just friends and I’m fine with that. She said “Idk bro” and I said I wasn’t feeling good so she told me to drink some water and maybe go to sleep and so I said goodnight. It’s the next morning now, should I text her and tell her I’m sorry for last night or just not say anything or what should I do	2
I think I’m going to kill myselfI gave birth 3 weeks ago and I cant handle this anymore. I’m so young and even before the baby I wanted to die. The stress and responsibilities are getting to me and I can’t even fuckinf sleep. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel like myself. I’ve tried talking to my mom and boyfriend and people but I can’t. I don’t know how to explain how I feel to people other than saying I don’t feel like myself and that I feel numb. I want this to end, I need this to end I can’t take it anymore.	1
Last night i found out i can't die in my dreams I'm not going into detail on how i found out, but it was kinda wack, it's kinda like being in a game with invincibility on. I usually dream about weird shit right before my alarm goes off and it's really weird, idk if anyone else does this.	2

Piece of shit.I've done some really bad things in my life to myself and others. Really bad. So many awful sins. Lied about it. Looking back I'm so ashamed of myself. I started over in 1993, but can't live down this shame. I don't put myself above anyone, even a serial killer, cause wrongs can't be compared. I've been a doormat and a runaway. No drugs or alcohol, but a life wasted on sexual impulses and no self esteem. I'm a grandma now, how do you live this shit down? some legacy. I finally came out and told my adult child I was no good, but loved him and we are all sinners. What else can I do? Just when I had a glimmer of hope, it all came tumbling down. 	1
"I'm not strong enough to carry on anymoreI've been here before. Being totally broken by a relationship, but this time it's different. It was my fault. I needed some time to think about if I was ready to just back in to a relationship and took 4 days to think. During that time the girl got into another relationship.

She was seeing somebody else but kissed me before I told her I needed some time. Then she never told me she was in a relationship and let me believe I was taking her out on a date over the weekend. It was only after I had kissed her that she told me she had a boyfriend. Despite that we went out for dinner and she held my hand and cuddled into my arm, crying a lot because she wants to be with me but she says 'she can't'. I took her home and she begged me to stay the night, to which I responded that it wouldn't be right. She told me 'we don't have to do anything, we can just cuddle', which to me implied she wanted more to happen. I wanted more to happen too but I left because I knew it would've hurt more if we slept together and she still couldn't be with me. 

I've waited 6 months through lockdown and covid restrictions for her. I went on one date with another girl but couldn't stop thinking about this first girl and so I told her my mistake. 

I'm honestly done at this point. This will be my third and final suicide attempt. I'm making sure I won't survive this time. 

I've given myself until Friday to get my stuff into order before I drift away into the long sleep."	1

I don't even care about getting betterI honestly have given up trying to get better. I was taken inpatient about a month ago and was there for a few days where they gave me meds and set up an appointment with a counselor. I missed the appointment and the next available one isn't until the end of November. My meds don't seem to be working and my regular doctor doesn't want to switch them and has given me a referral to see a psychiatrist. It just seems like I'm ready to die right now and if I could get help in the next week I could get better, but I can't. I'm done waiting and ready to just kick the bucket. 	1
Too Scared to Die, Too Tired to Live. (A rant, I guess?)Hey, I don’t know if the title makes sense.. but here you go. You know depression, lows and highs and lows and highs, a never ending vicious cycle. I’m in one of the lows lately. Haven’t showered in a week (usually one every two days is my schedule), house is a mess for the last 2 months (haven’t cleaned once) and I feel truly bad. I don’t want to live anymore NOT because I see no hope for my future (I do, truly) but because I feel like even on my happiest days, I will struggle with depression and even the idea is making me exhausted. Almost like I am completely taken over by darkness but here is the thing.. I will never kill myself even though I want to stop existing everyday. Everyday I wish I wasn’t present in this world; feeling, thinking... but I will never kill myself because I have an extreme fear of death (Thanatophobia). I was brought up atheist so I never had an afterlife concept, no hell or heaven, just darkness. I think it was this that caused me to have a fear of death from a young age. I used to have panic attacks thinking about death at the ages of 9-10. This never went away and I carried it to my adulthood as well. Thanatophobia is not only causing me to stay alive, but it is also feeding my depression. I simply cannot make peace with the knowledge of all will come to an end someday. And I will not be the one to determine which day that will be. So, this is not hopeful, this is not positive. This is not me saying “I will stay alive because I want to.” This is me saying fear has a big role in me being alive and it is a type of torture everyday of the week, constantly.	1
"I'm confused.I'm thinking about suicide everyday about two years. I think I will never try it because I afraid to die, but the idea of suicide gives me chill... and sometimes it seems like the only way... 

things are getting worse every day where I live. almost everyone I met is stupid, unreliable and angry. I hate to talking people except my family, in fact I don't even talk with my family because they always find to say things that makes me angry. it just makes me sick. but I have to survive. I'm not working since I graduated from college. I need money. I can't live like this forever. I have to communicate with those people. I have to work with them. even this idea scares me, not like social phobia or something else, I just don't want to do it. it always surprises me that how I graduated from those schools without any nervous breakdown. except the fake friends, I was always alone and I can say that my most beautiful years gone wasted, and it was just because of this two faced society. they were/they are hypocrite and abusive every topic you can imagine. I preferred to stay away for not to get any harm, but it wasn't enough. they broke my heart a lot. and I know nothing gonna change about them.

I know what I don't want to do, but I don't know what else I can do.  even if I decide what I'm gonna do, the place where I live  won't give me any chance. and the time is running out. I'm looking at people around me, on the internet... and they don't think deep. they don't even think. all they do is talking about themselves, talking about their endless problems...

I love this life. I love breathing, my eyes, my ears, every part of my body works just fine. but somehow, it's not enough. it can't stop the things going through my head. sometimes I'm planning every single detail, and sometimes the idea comes like "" hey, jump from there. it's gonna be fine"". 

this is not a help call or something, like I said I'm not gonna try to suicide. I just wanted to share my thoughts..."	1

"I have lost my desire to live and want to dieHello, I'm not sure where to start, but I am just going to start typing to put the thoughts in my head down in some sort of unorganized manner.  I apologize in advance for my poor grammar and scattered thought process.  I'm currently drunk while typing this after finding out my ex has moved on to another person.  I'm watching football, and that used to make me very happy. I don't care about it today. I'm severely depressed. I don't want to be alive any longer. The only things that keep me going are the fact that I have a wonderful dog who would be devastated and without a home if I passed away, and my mom would be devastated if I passed away.  

I have no job, no potential employment, about $15,000 in student loan debt, a $223 per month car payment, I'm expected to pay $890 at the end of the month for rent, I no longer have health insurance, and I don't have enough to cover those bills in the bank. My ex-girlfriend who was an absolute gift in my life that I never deserved left me a few months ago due to my chronic abuse of marijuana and alcohol on a daily basis, and I am completely unable to get over it. I dream about her a couple times a week, and while I'm awake, the poor decisions that I made while we were in a relationship are daily reminders to me about how shitty of a person I am.  When I dream about her, we are happy, but when I wake up, reality hits me and I'm sad when I wake up almost every morning/afternoon.  She was wonderful and treated me more kindly than any other person I've known.  On top of that, she is absolutely beautiful from head to toe and inside out. She's the only woman I've ever met that doesn't compromise her morals for other people or situations.  I became too much of a burden on her life, and she left me when she went to study abroad in September of this year.  

I've been thinking about killing myself for years, and I don't own a firearm for the fear that I would use it on myself in a moment of complete depression and sadness. 

Since I was a child I was told that I had ADHD, and I was put on a regiment of Ritalin, Concerta, or Adderall (sorry if they are spelled wrong), and I think that's what began my addictive lifestyle. I have quit smoking, but I drink at least 5 days a week. When I'm not drinking, I often think about drinking. I'm unorganized, have months of mail that deals with bills and unpaid taxes and such.  I'm messy and don't know where to start to fix things, so I just ignore them.  My mother is a hoarder, and many of those tendencies have become my own as I grow older.  I hate that about me. I hate most things about me. I often find myself wishing that I had cancer or some debilitating disease so that I have an excuse as to why I feel as hopeless and sad as I do. I keep everything hidden from my family and friends. I justify it by telling myself that I don't want to be a reason for them to be unhappy. I would much rather see and make them happy than bring them down with the problems that plague my mind on a daily basis.  

As far as the things that make me happy go, they are few.  I have recently begun coaching volleyball for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. I'm not fully qualified yet, so I don't get paid, but coaching is an absolute joy for me. When I coach, all my problems melt away and I'm focused on the issues at hand which are teaching the girls on how to be better at volleyball.  I currently help out an elderly gentleman with his teams because I'm 27 and able to do much more than he is when it comes to the physical demands of coaching.  I am in the process of becoming a qualified coach, but I'm dragging my feet, so to speak, for some reason.  

Today I am thinking about ending my life more than any other.  I have already chosen the place that I would like to do it so as to decrease the shock upon people and family as much as possible.  I have already begun writing the letters and thinking out what I want to say to the people who would be directly affected by my abrupt death.  This post is quite possibly my last outcry to try and save my life.  I have lost every desire to even wake up in the morning. I'm am bombarded and reminded of my problems from financial to emotional as soon as I wake up each day, so that makes me not want to wake up anymore.  

On a daily, and sometimes hourly basis, I remind myself of how much of a loser/failure I am. I have had so many opportunities for further education and employment pass me by, and I feel like there isn't much hope left for me.  I can't make enough money to pay my bills even when I do become a fully qualified volleyball coach so that I can be paid.  I no longer desire to be happy because after my somewhat momentary happiness ends there is always the crippling reminder by my mind of the actual situation that I find myself in.  

I appreciate anyone who reads this as my last outcry to salvage any type of productive/happy life that I might have.  If you can't make a difference in my life, I don't blame you. Most likely I will be dead in a few weeks once the New Years rolls around.  That's my plan at least. 

I view myself as completely undesirable and unwanted from birth to adulthood. I am largely a burden from financial reasons to emotional reasons to the people/family that are involved in my life. 

I could use some help. I want to die, but I want to live at the same time. Life is hard, and I don't know how to function properly as an adult.  If you are reading this for the first time in 2017, then just ignore it because i am most likely already dead.  

Thank you to anyone who has spent their time reading this rambling of thoughts and emotions.  I hope you have a happier life than I have and make more constructive decisions than I have.  I don't believe in God, so I have no hope for the afterlife.  I may fall sleep soon. I've had about 6 shots of vodka since I began writing this.

Thank you, and I'm sorry to burden your life with my problems.   "	1

Please if you have someone who’s not too far gone like I am, talk to them. Be there for them. Support them. They need you more than ever. Don’t let them slip. You will regret it when they’re gone.

"I'm tired of trying.I can't make friends for the life of me. I've got buddies I hang around with at uni and thats it. I guess my dumb trigger today was those buddies talking about how they went to a hip hip party the other night with buddy A's friends. Buddy B doesn't even like hip hop, I do and live 10 minutes away from buddy A but they like each other. I don't have that with anyone.

""Get hobbies"" I have multiple social and socialish hobbies

""volunteer"" I have done in the past but with my hobbies, university and work I don't have time at the moment

It doesn't make a difference because I'm still the same boring old me no matter where I go.

I've been to social skills classes, I've tried to invite people out only to receive silence or rejection. I've read book after book and watched Ted talk after Ted talk. I suck at conversations, thinking of things to say. I'm probably an energy drain without realising it. I don't want to wait for ""ThE OnE"" in a romantic sense. I'm lonely and don't want to live like this anymore. What's the point of working hard for money and then Is suicide only a depression thing? Why can't it be a logical choice?

Maybe I'm a damn alien I can't connect with people. Even when I think I've clicked with a person it means nothing to them.

Maybe people can smell desperation but i don't know what else to do. I'm normally one to try to fix an issue instead of complain but I'm done.  I want to spend time with people. I'll probably end it after university so I wouldn't have failed college twice. I want to at least get a 1st/A, go out on a high. "	1
"I should probably pace myself since this is like the 3rd time I've uploaded in 24 hours, but heres an acoustic cover of Pompeji by Deftones that I just did. https://youtu.be/dGoYoWWuqR4



I'm actually really happy with how this sounds on an acoustic, especially cause the song originally uses an 8 string guitar. Plus I learned it mostly by ear so I'm kinda proud of that. Enjoy!"	2
"I think 0/0 is ""countable"" infinity. If my understanding of ""countable infinity"" is correct (it is a ""real"" number), I believe that zero divided by zero is countable infinity. My reasoning is such: Anything divided by zero is infinity, as zero fits infinite times into any number. Plus, if a÷b=c, ac=b and bc=a. Therefore, countable infinity times zero is zero and so 0/0=countable infinity."	2

"I don't want to be a whinny but i just can't take it anymore...Firstly, my apology for poor writing since English is not my first language. I'm trying to write as much understandable as i can.

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said ""the higher you climb, the harder you fall"", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on.
My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.
 Now i am in a place far away from home, can't talk to my family since I don't want them to worry sick about me and can't talk to my friends since they have too much to worry already. I have to admit that ever since i lost my job, the suicidal thought have just kept haunting me and today after what happened, i feel that tomorrow would be the last day for me.
I don't want to be a whiner, a pussy and hopefully won't cost too much of your precious time but anyone, just anybody please tell how can i get through this..."	1

Almost everyone, even idiots, got 100 scores on 3 subjects.

I studied hard and got 1 question wrong on each subjects.

Today's exam was the easiest exam in my middle school life but I fucking made mistakes.

This puts me in a bad position and I don't want to even live anymore.

I fucking deserve to die.

Outside of work I have no life.  Sleep, and food are the only mild joys I get anymore. I will die a virgin as well,  outside of paying a few hookers to sleep with me. I cannot bear that I am unable to attract women due to something outside of my control,  an ugly face,  and horrible genetics overall. This weekend I am getting a motel, and overdosing on pills. I live with a few people,  and cannot bear to have them find me. I'm not looking for sympathy,  or even care if I get any response. Peace out cruel world 	1

But it seems to have no effect on me.
Doesn’t make me sick
Or doesn’t give me any sort of headache either.

Now I started cutting myself again but just blood doesn’t seem to help.
I don’t know if this is even the right place to say this.
So I started hurting myself every possible way.
Taking overdose, can’t get drugs cuz it’s nearly impossible for me to get any cuz of corona virus.

No where else to post this This happend before I had reddit but I'm so happy (: my cat actually loves me. I used to sit on the living room floor to play video games, and some how my cat got got in to the house (he usually is inside) but when he did he put a big and I mean BIG Bird and put it exactly where I sit. That means that instead of eating the bird or whatever cats do with animal carcasses, but he put it where I would see it so I could be fed. My cat caught a big ass bird just for me and I love him so much for that.	2
"Banned from a suicide chat for having common sense        Hey yall. I was having a moment so i decided to go to the Chatzy Suicide room (yes I'm saying names, I'm infuriated). It has a lot of cool people and when I'm there, I forget my problems. So we were just chillin, me and some 4 or 5 other people when a mod walks in. Me not knowing they were a mod and tryna be welcoming, I went over the top and instead of asking ""how you doin"" I asked ""how ya pussy"" (i realize that's bad) and they asked me to rephrase that and I apologized and everything went fine. 
        After that, she (who had just declared to be a female) suddenly cleans everyone's chat history. I asked what was going on and she says this girl is multi accounting. People come up with evidence to back that theory up, and the mod asks when did the ""boyfriend"" come into the chat. She doesn't really know, and we move on. I didn't quite understand what was going on (a lot of people were talking at the same time) and asked for details such as how does the mod know that. I proceed to call her a dick because she's discussing beef while people need help, right about then entered a girl saying she was thinking of killing herself and I tried to help. Then I got banned. I emailed the chat staff about it and they haven't gotten back to me yet. I'm infuriated, that i got banned for having a point. What do yall think? AITA?"	1
"I just want to ventI've been depressed my whole life, and became suicidal 2 years ago. I've tried one shoddy attempt at suffocating myself once with a plastic bag and rope, but that was it so far. I do fantasize about it all the time, daily, even as I type this. I tried to talk to my dad about it  several times, but he thinks its just bullshit. I talked to my sister about it a lot, but she always seemed to just brush it off because  she went through a depressive streak and slashed her wrists, but got over it somehow. 


She went and had a kid with an abusive drug addicted criminal, and now she is going through a nasty custody battle with him. I am being supportive, listening to her, being understanding, reassuring her, basically just trying to help her out as best as I can, and not stress her out. I also help her pay for some minor things and help babysit my nephew, as well go to court with her to give her a moral boost. She moved back in with me and our abusive parents, and I tried my damn hardest to make sure they focused most of their crap on me instead of her. She was only able to last a month with them. 


So we go to court last week, nothing really happens but the crazy guy's lawyer scares the shit out of my sister, so she calls me hysterically crying saying she wants kill herself. I somehow manage to calm her down and cheer her up pretty quickly, we talk some more, and she hangs up. And now here is the problem, ever since that phone call I get extremely angry when I get my suicidal thoughts. It's like those thoughts have been a comforting thing for me, something I could control. When now I can't think about them, because if I go and off myself my sister and nephew will have no one to help them. Anyone have any advice? This shit makes my angry just typing it.


**TL;DR:** Suicidal thoughts daily. Sister only semi supportive. Sister needs help, I help her. One day she calls me telling me she wants to kill herself. Now I get extremely angry when I get suicidal, because I can't kill myself and leave my dumb sister by herself."	1
What is the best way to prepare friends for my suicide?Should I just not tell them? Or would it be better to slip some things into conversation on a similar situation on how people deal with it?

"Today was one of the greatest days of my life so far. So this year overall sucks. We can agree on that. Me personally I started having a rough year. In January I managed to tear my ACL and meniscus, then COVID hit so even when I could walk again I couldn’t do anything because of the lockdown. My drivers test got postponed and I couldn’t get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, I’m doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work. (I was always an introvert and with my job I’m meeting people that I enjoy hanging with) this eventually led to me being invited to my first Halloween party in close to 10 years and just overall being a happier person.
My dad asked me if I wanted to meet for dinner after work, I said yes and met him at a restaurant near where I work. (Just so y’all know there are no family issues we just don’t see eachother a lot because of work schedules.) after a bit of talking he says how proud he is of me and all the accomplishments I’ve made this year thus far, and how proud of a dad he is. 

I’m so happy right now and I’m so happy my life is taking suck a wonderful turn around! 
I just wanted to say this. To anyone who read through the whole thing I thank you. If you are going through rough times you WILL find a way out!
Much love everyone"	2

I went from laughing everyday as a child to feeling numb as an adultI don’t know anymore.... I can’t feel anything, I can’t connect with anyone.  Today I finally understood the reason I feel so numb, I realized people aren’t there forever and everyone leaves. I’m a terrible person honestly.... I sleep with so many girls and cheat when I’m in a relationship. I don’t want to be in my body anymore or on this planet. The one girl that was there I fucked up with her and she won’t ever talk to me again. I’m not writing this to throw a pity party for myself, just because I don’t have anyone to say goodbye too. Whoever reads this please don’t say it all gets better and stuff like that because life doesn’t work that way..... At least I got to say goodbye to someone. 	1

"Found my partner a new love so I can end a little more peacefullyI hope this is alright to post here. This is my first and probably only post on Reddit, I just... need to say something before it happens.

I (20 M) have been with my partner (20 M) for almost 3 years and I love him dearly. I have also been battling self harm since I was 13 and having ups and downs with my success. Lately, everything has taken a turn for the worse and for the past year I have been seriously considering killing myself, and recently have decided that it would be the best course of action. I've been working on wrapping up all of my loose ends, and have been looking for a way to get my partner taken care of without me. Recently, we discussed adding another person to the relationship, and together we managed to connect with a very sweet woman who my partner has fallen for. She is really darling and I am so happy that she will be there, at least in the beginning. I hope that he is able to at least realize through her that I am not the only one he can have.

Neither of them know I plan to take my life. I love him so much and I am so glad that he will have a chance to keep going after I am gone. I know what I plan to do is selfish and destructive but now that he is just a little safer I feel less guilty and like I can finally let go of all of this pain."	1

Fuck senior year Of course I get this shit. I have t applied to college yet fuck I might not even graduate. This year is shit and honestly it’s not due to corona per se it’s due to my school fucking us over. Senior paper due 2 months early? Sure why not. I’ve been getting fucked left and right by my administration and I’m done with it. If you’re a parent reading this talk to your fucking kids and make sure they are doing okay and make sure they know you’re open to talk. This year has been terrible and I’ve dealt with depression bouts before but nothing serious but holy god this year has been hell. Honestly I’d say for the past 2 months I’ve wanted to kms. I’ve seriously thought about it. I doubt I will but still I don’t think film study grade should have a student thinking about how easy it would be to just do it. My school is so high pressure and we don’t get any mental breaks. It’s top 100 and I’m not saying that to brag I’m saying that so you all might understand how much shit we put up with.

"I'll never be as happy as I was when I was littleI just don't feel like I see any point in anything anymore if I can't be happy. 

I don't really know where to start, or what I'm doing, but here I go.

I'm very shy and private-I think I always have been- and I don't ever feel really comfortable talking to people I'm not really familiar with. Even online, I'm pretty much always a lurker. As a result, I only have a handful of people I feel like I can go to when I'm feeling depressed. And I just feel like I bring the people I love down all the time. I'm so needy but I have nothing to offer. I'm like a child and I don't understand why I even have the few friends I do.

My dog is dying. He has a cancerous lump that's enormous, and has been growing for about a year and a half now. I know not everyone will understand, and I'm not trying to equate this with losing a human being, but losing my dog is really, really hard. He's been my constant friend since I was 3 years old (I'm 19 now), he moved with me from one country to another, and he's always been so gentle and sweet. I know he'll be gone soon and I'm trying so hard to prepare myself but today on the train I finally just started crying. I imagined what it would be like never to get to hug him again and it was torture. I'm away from home right now so I'm sitting here in my dorm hugging my stuffed animal like an infant pretending its him.

On top of it, my anxiety has gotten out of control. I've always had it but I think college has made it much, much worse. I'm very rarely cheerful. I'm happiest when I imagine what I want my future to be like. Silly things like pretending I'm best friends with Quentin Tarantino or that I write for the Daily Show. I feel like my imagination has been able to sustain me for 19 years but I'm old enough now to realize those things will probably never happen, and right now I don't feel like I have anything that makes me as happy as my stupid Mary Sue dreams that wont ever come true.

I used to want to be a writer but more and more I feel like I have nothing to say, and no motivation to try. Ironically, I really want to write comedy, because it's the stuff that's always made me happiest, but I just don't think I have the ability to make others as happy as comedy has made me. So even watching things that used to make me laugh feels painful.

There's so many things I want to do, but more and more I'm realizing I'm not nearly as special as I wish I were. Aside from being a good comfort to my mom (she's been depressed since her best friend of 36 years died a few years back) there's nothing I feel like I can do. I used to dream so big and for the past few years I've been forced to come to terms with how small I really am. And I just don't see the point of living for probably decades more if I'll never be as happy as I was when I was, like, 5 years old and going to Disney for the first time. I just don't think I'm cut out for it.

I'm sorry this is so long, and I don't really know what I want from this, I just felt the need to write something. I don't want to bother my friends anymore."	1

"Life feels so overwhelming...Hello 

I don't even know where to start, but right now, things are really bad - or feel really bad at least. I'm aware that a lot of it has to do with how I experience it and I think this might make it worse. 

Right now, I have a week off annual leave that I've been looking forward to for months. But now we're in full lockdown again and even though I don't want to go outside (thanks to OCD), it just frustrates me that I don't really have too many options - no cinema, no restaurant visits... I understand it's necessary, but it's still hard. 

I have no family or friends nearby either. Just housemates that I don't get along with very well. Or rather, that I don't really want to talk to as that would drag me down even more.

I have a therapist, but I feel that the quality of therapy just gets worse and worse, we don't really resolve anything, we just chat. Which is nice, in a way, but it doesn't really help in the long run. She told me to contact her whenever I need to get something off my chest, but she doesn't really reply to it anymore, which kind of defies the purpose. 
I know that most therapists probably wouldn't be available 24/7, and that's understandable - but I do miss those replies she used to send, a short text or voice message, sometimes giving advice or even just to acknowledge it. 

She pretty much is the only person I can talk to. My family would just tell me to get my stuff together. 

I do have a best friend, but she seems very distant recently too. Maybe it's the situation as a whole, maybe some external factor, maybe I'm just such a pain? I can't even ask that as I'd be worried she would just sugarcoat  the answer (Or start to feel annoyed if I keep asking why she's so distant/if she still wants to go on holidays once it's safe to do so).

I think the only reason I'm still here is that I know deep inside that I mean... at least something to some people. Probably not as much as I wish I would, but that's something I only have so much control over. I try my best, but I can't tell what other people are thinking. 
(Well. And because I just got that off my chest)

Alright. Thank you for reading!

Wonder when they'll find my bodyI'm tired of being a fraction of a person. I dont remember anything anymore and I cant put a full sentence together in my head anymore. My friends used to try to remind me of things wed done together or times we had shared but those memories and the capability to feel something on that level again are permanently gone. I dont remember who I was. I've wanted to die for nearly 20 years. I'm almost 30.  There is no future for me I wish my friends and family would accept that and let me die. I dont feel anything towards them. I dont remember what it felt like to love them or be loved by them and doubtful I ever will again.	1

I am aware this question must have been asked a lot in the past but what I see is only advice for men, like to ""man up"" and to certain things but I do not have money or resources to do most of them so if you are a man and give me advice give it with a grain salt, knowing that I do not live in America, but in Europe, I am a woman so I can't ""grow balls"" or ""beat up everyone I want to for fun"" or ""walk around freely with a knife or a gun"" like it was suggested in some other thread I saw 

P.S. I am not in high school and it is quite offensive to think I am, so now. I am an adult. Thank you.

The problem: My life experience has shown me that it is foolish to expect everyone to be your friend and to be nice to you just because you are nice. but the solution really annoys me and scares me because I know what happens when I put it to work, everyone avoids me and calls me a bitch, yet it somehow works for everyone else. Many girls I know, the most popular girls usually were really mean, so were the boys. So my nice \*\*\* ever tries to be mean or fight back when harassed and it becomes a really big problem, either the harasser laughs at me and continues to harass me or people just avoid me because they think I am confrontational and problematic, which I am not, I do not like conflicts but staying on my \*\*\* and never calling out people who used to bully me for years has proven to not be effective. They just continue to harass me no matter if I ignore them or call them out on their behavior

My goal is to understand this whole power play dynamic and why it takes place. Does my type of personality attract bullying? I remember having problems with it all of my life. Let me explain why I had this short prologue in the beginning. The stereotypical american online does not care much about the outside world. The laws of my country are very, very different from America, yet I have had people shame me for my problems or give me horrible advice in general or both. No, life is not an action movie and I am not the karate kid, No I am not a \*insert slur\* because I can't beat up a gang of guys on steroids, No where I live it is not okay to take a knife and stab my classmates( This advice was given to me by an american high school teacher, so good job!!!) I always have to explain to my self because most people on here give bad advice but some give brilliant and great advice that works for me. I am not saying all users are like those I gave example of and I have blocked and reported these people. I can write all day long about my encounters with weird people from reddit and quora but the point is for me to get  a good advice and not whine to all of you about each detail of my life. Some males on here can't imagine the female perspective and give really terrible advices and some males on here give really good universal advices that work for me.

I am deeply flawed so I have read books on self improvement and I would dare to say that I have made small self improvement which is better than none

I had a panic attack today and yesterday, was trembling and crying and felt like I was holding a really heavy box that I couldn't let go of. After crying for an hour and a half I seemed to calm down but felt better. I mentioned in my last post that I do not know any reasons why I am alive, I do not speak about my \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* thoughts antymore because one ""apperently christian"" classmate made fun of me after I kinda shared this to her on a school trip

(I have been heavily bullied in middle and high school and have a hard time making friends)

I now have ptsd, am full of shame, guilt, grief and struggle to find any reason to live. I feel ugly and broken beyond repair and am ashamed to go to another psychologist. I feel dirtied and r\*\*\*d and do not want to marry one of those people with the male genitalia or have children yet those who bullied me probably do not remember me and will have children while I will die alone. I just want this to end but now my parents watch me because I self hurt and stopped washing when I was 16 and felt the most suicidal during 10th grade. I still get ""waves"" of desire for suicide but I find it hard to find my purpose.

I try to eradicate my onw flaws - people pleasing, needyness, clingyness, desparation(Out of need for survival, I was desperate for friends yet did not know how to make them so here it is like unwritten rule that if you are alone you will be bullied and I am very vulnerable to bullying and can't deal with it which is why I was an easy target, i couldn't defend my self and no one took me seriously and if i ever defend my self people either laughed or threatened to beat me up. I also used to be overhappy which for some weird reason unnerved people. I am not autistic or on the spectrum but I have adhd, and sometimes my anxiety and adhd, create social problems but I have never been good. 

Half of the things I read about body language and communication skills baffle me and they seem genuienely stupid (like I avoid eye contact cause to me it seemed perverted yet the dumb males think it is submissive and take it as a que to harass me, great job. ) I am tired of this world and do not know what to mold my self into anymore to survive. I am ashamed of the fact that I have trauma and have to deal with it. I have had strangers bully me and laugh at me and even old men flirting with me which made me isolate my self even more. 

Important:

I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE A B TO EVERYONE IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY SELF AND SURVIVE AND SHOW THE DUMB MALE GENDER THAT I AM NOT WEAK AND I AM NOT UGLY AND I DO NOT WANT OR DESERVE TO BE HARASSED AND BULLIED. If I am nice they harass me, if I am mean, they harass me. Like what is the point, they will go to the heartless pretty b anyway, so I stand no chance and do not want my life purpose to revolve around the others and expecting of them to be nice to me. I do not feel like I am safe around men, I feel like they would beat me up, and I see women as a competetion due to the hostile bullying in my past. I know guys are dumb enough to fall for literally the meanest girls when I was in school so I will no longer waste my time on them and just try to not \*\*\* my self and focus on me. I try to develop my hobbies but my mind is plauging me and I feel the need to \*\*\* my self, by either taking overdose with pills or my father's pistol and just shooting towards my heart so I would not miss. Phrases like - OOOh not all men are bad, scare me because it is a risk and 8/10 times guys are horrible so it is not wroth it. I do not want to date, marry, or have children. I want to give up on men and realize this mindset is toxic but do not feel physically safe around those with the d\*cks"	1
"Fuck this shit. I'm finally done.I'm ending it. I've been going through bullshit day in and day out every single motherfucking day of my life.

I cry every morning when I wake up, I cry during the day if I can find a place to be alone, and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I don't have any friends. I haven't had any friends for over a year. I am sociable, but people don't want to hang out with me.

My mom is verbally and psychologically abusive. My job hates me and threatens to fire me all the time. Then I would have bills to pay that I couldn't pay. I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

I was trying to make brownies earlier, and I spilled a little bit of chocolate on the counter. Maybe the size of a quarter. My mom went ape-shit telling me how I need to take a cooking class and calling me a ""fucking retard"" and saying, ""What did I do to deserve you as a child?"" that there's ""chocolate everywhere; all over the counter, paper towels, in the sink"" and none of this bullshit is fucking true. I am a neat freak. I'm not a slob.

I always try to not let it bother me, but fuck, it fucking bothers me enough that I've decided to end my life. If she hears me crying she says ""fuck you"" and if I continue to cry she takes my car keys away (by force, I will fight her) and take my cell phone away and probably try to choke me which she has done before.

I'm 19 years old and I already feel too old for this. I am so tired that I feel like I'm 90. I'm tearing up and so afraid to cry that it's making it harder to hold it in.

I always kinda felt bad about thinking about killing myself by thinking my family would miss me. Maybe they will, and maybe my mom will be miserable forever but now that is what I *want*. My mom always tells my family members that I am a horrible person. That I lie and steal, and that I do horrible things that I have never done in my life. She lies to their faces in front of me, and I have to get lectured every time I see them about something stupid my mom told them I did.

Fuck them all. Fuck everything. I want to open up a space for another child to grow and have a decent life. There's too many people on the planet anyway. Thanks for listening."	1
"Do you learn to cope?I'm having just about the worst month I've ever had in regards to depression. The anxiety that I have isn't helping either and I find myself constantly wishing I wouldn't wake up when I go to sleep or just fantasizing how I would end it so I don't have to deal with this anymore...

Are there any exercises or rituals that people have to learn to deal with or mitigate these thoughts? Thanks.."	1

"No reason to live / tired of life / don't feel like living anymoreHi,

Reading this article made me feel more depressed / like killing myself / tired of life / not believing in God / the afterlife. I'm black / can't be on the level of these people. I want  to get a gun and shoot my brains out. If there's a god / afterlife I want to be in hell rather than be with a so called loving god that made my life hell. I can't do math / am disabled.

Dreams are stupid Can we talk about how dreams are unbelievably stupid? A few days ago, I had a dream where me and the more athletic version of my sister’s boyfriend from two years ago were in the street in front of my house. It was dark outside and the only light was a dim street light that’s on the corner of my house. We were confronted by a mixed race Michael Cera, wearing a basketball jersey, holding up a sign saying,”I’m not racist”. He then rips part of the sign that says “not”, and as you guessed it reads out,”I’m racist”. He then runs towards us and we start fighting back. Except in my dream, I jumped onto his back to sorta disable him and my sister’s boyfriend is the one beating him up. We then beat him up to the point where he’s a tiny person, and we poke his eyes out. Then all of a sudden, we’re inside holding a tiny, frail baby that looks like it was boiled in water. So of course, I didn’t go back to sleep after that. Needles to say, I don’t know wtf my dreams are anymore.	2
So my dad asked what a Karen was My brother and I explained it to him who they and I think he gets it. Thankfully my mom is not a Karen so we don’t have to hold anything back. Now he looked up “Karen videos” and he’s just like confused and and horrified like anyone should be at that amount of racism and hate. He told my brother and me we had a good description so, yay brownie points I guess.	2
"I am nothing. I have nothing.My husband has been having his ""last night of drinking"" for three months. After 3 years of problem drinking. This excuses maxing out my card, his card, spending every dime including change from penny jar, getting deposits back at the beer store - it's always the last night so do your worst, right?

For weeks I've worked overtime shifts from 4:30am and again from 8pm-midnight just so we can pay bills. I literally sleep 2 non-consecutive hours each night. I'm a teacher, he hasn't been to work since the 3rd because of ""medical leave"" AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since. I have to fast for the next 3 weeks which is actually ok, I've done it for weeks before, but also necessary because we don't have any food. He's skinny and can't skip meals, I'm a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless, horrible drunk. 

My friends have homes, have families. He's alienated me from everyone - I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another. I have no friends. I have become a drunk, too - at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop. I spend most evenings hiding booze from him, hiding cards, hiding keys. He drinks until his head bobs around, until he stumbles and breaks things and 100% denies he's drunk. 

I never should have gone to university. I never should have left that shithole town. I should have married the best farmer and shut my fucking mouth. I hate my life. I hate every day I wake up. 

I hate myself for not doing it already. I've cut my arms open but never deep enough. I hung myself but not privately enough. I've overdosed but barfed most of it up. 

The only thing keeping me alive is knowing he won't take proper care of my dog. "	1
"I hate men so much they make me want to kill myselfI'm standard Barbie kinda hot. I have two Masters degrees and an amazing career that no one seems to give a fuck about. The way men approach me is ALWAYS fucking ALWAYS seductive. I am a prey. I live in danger of being looked at and touched without my consent. 
Months ago these behaviours started to really oppress me and I didn't feel safe in many places. I stopped putting on make up, stopped wearing skirts and dresses. 
But last week end was too much. Someone slipped something in my drink at the club and I miraculously escaped and fainted in a taxi that took me to the hospital. 
The next morning, I cut all my hair - 25cm.

I don't want to do all this. I don't want to live in fear. I want to look at myself in the mirror and think I'm beautiful. It's so unfair that I have to look neglected in order to be left alone.

Men I've been in relationships with cheated on me, lied to me, used me.

I think I don't want to live in this world. It's a never-ending battle against men and I will always lose."	1

My dad finally having the son he always wanted after 2. So my parents had told us that my mom was pregnant and hoping it's a boy. My brother is 21 and I'm 18. My dad's name is Jesús and mine and my brother's is Jimmy and Jesse. He said he always wanted to name their first kid his own name but my brother never got that. Neither did I. So now that my parents know about how me and my brother, my brother kinda being irresponsible sometimes and me having ADHD and having my head cracked opened twice but only in minor damages, they hope the new kid doesn't disappoint them like we did.	2
I am a little confused about my gender I am a 16 year old guy. I have always hated things like how i looked or my name, and. I thought this was just low self esteem and normal, but my friend bullied me into getting snapchat, and i was messing around with the filters, and i found all the make up ones. And i loved how they made me look. I posted about this to a different subreddit and i got really mixed answers, i was wondering if anyone could help me out here. I really don't know if this means anything, or if its totally normal for people my age to experience and means nothing.	2

I've been on medication for almost 4 weeks now, and I thought that it was helping, but apparently not anymore.	1

Why do I even exist?Feels like I'm used as a punching bag for other people's emotional baggage and then thrown out into the cold like an animal. Is this what I'm here for? I have 3 people relying on me emotionally who would be devastated and have no emotional support if I died, but 0 of them I can go to. I feel like I'm a dropbox where people drop their negative emotions until I'm overflowing with them and can't breathe. Do I even exist beyond that purpose to these people? Why am I even here?	1
"Tried multiple times. I think I'm going to succeed tonight.Maybe if I ask someone to push me off the edge into the ocean; offer to pay them, they may help me finally succeed. 
I've been married for almost two years now, to a guy who never understood how I feel. And today, he hit me. Slapped me. Punched me. Pushed me. And covered my nose and face to muffle my screams, so hard, that I thought I'd die from loss of breath. Then, he booked me tickets to my parent's, and asked me to leave the very next morning. 

I don't want to stay with him. Of course not. But going back to my parents is not an option. I have no money, no friends, nothing. Everyone thinks I am in this happy marriage because I have lead them to believe so. And there is not one person I am comfortable in confiding. I had taken to cutting myself to calm myself down. But tonight, I don't even want to do that. Cutting only leaves me with bruises and no solutions. There is no solution, in fact. I am from that part of the world where a divorce is not the solution. I'll only end up bringing disgrace to my family. And knowing myself, I also know I will not be able to kill myself. But I really want to die. I'm really thinking of asking someone roaming alone at night, someone who looks like he may do it, to take whatever money I have in my pockets, and just push me. "	1
One Step Forward, Six Steps BackYesterday I was having a good day. And then last night hit and I’m right back to where I am now. Alone with nothing but dark thoughts and the extreme urge to just die. Or maybe not exist. Same thing, really. My stomach physically hurts and my stress is out of control. I’m actually ruined, a failing excuse of a human being. I have no motivation to do anything. I’d rather just lay here and pray that sleep is my only escape. But sleep causes dreams and I don’t want any more dreams because they’re fucking painful. So instead I lay all night awake, with these thoughts clouding my brain. And morning comes, and it’s just an endless cycle of the same shit. Maybe everyone is right, I’m too fucked up. I hate this.	1
"Low mood from issues at work(Also posted on r/advice)

23, M, UK

Evening all. I’m relatively new to reddit but have been lurking a while and noticed that this sub gives decent advice, and I’m feeling quite low this evening and feel I need to share my thoughts if you don’t mind.

I’ve been at my place of work three years, I love it. It’s the industry I’ve always wanted to work in, the pay and benefits are great and I love the day to day stuff. I’ve attached myself to a group of friends which is great too, but over the past year there’s been a few times where people inside this friendship group have made some comments “in jest” which have really hurt me. I’ve tried writing it off as banter plenty of times, and I know I am oversensitive so have to write some of it off as that too, but especially recently I’ve been struggling to cope more and more. 

Like this afternoon for example; I was in a perfectly happy mood having worked on my own all day, then walk into the office to complete some paperwork before I go home and three of the guys are in there. The dominant influencer of the three makes some comments dressed as “banter”, and instantly I feel a sense of dread. Like someone has pressed a light switch, I feel a warm queasy feeling all over my body and I feel my chest go all fluttery. I struggle not to cry in front of them and leave quickly. I won’t go into the comments made, not because they are particularly nasty or anything but it requires inside knowledge of the job I do and that would take even longer to explain. 

Anyway so I’m feeling pretty terrible about all this, and begin to have violent visualisations where I’m hurting myself, like deeply cutting into my arms or falling from a tall building and my bones smashing. I can’t stop these visions from appearing in my head and I’m almost craving the physical sensation that they depict. I do have a history of depression and low mood which stems from childhood (I’m 23 now).  In recent times these visions of me hurting myself seem to become my default response to feeling low. The violent thoughts soon progress into suicidal thoughts and I then spiral and get more &amp; more upset.

I can’t tell work how I feel because if I admit the thoughts in my head I will be taken away from the work that I love and probably end up being made to go sick which will make me feel 100x worse.

My bf knows I get sad from time to time but I don’t want to burden him with my problems because I’m scared that it’ll put him off (which is pretty illogical because we live together and have been together a good while). I don’t like burdening my parents either because they’ve got their own worries. 

I don’t want to confront the boy because when I’ve told him before that he’s upset me I’m made to feel like the one in the wrong because I can’t handle the banter. Likewise I can’t report it to work because I don’t want to be labelled a grass, and I’ve always believed I should have the courage to confront the person and if I can’t or won’t do that then I shouldn’t get anyone else involved.

I know I’m giving excuses for literally every possible solution, (and I’m sorry about that because I can’t stand it when others do that) but I guess just writing this post is helping to a degree 

Thanks for listening to me, anon internet user. Wish I had the balls to tell someone in real life.

TLDR: Friends at work are saying hurtful things, I’m unsure if I’m being oversensitive but regardless it’s causing me to have violent visualisations of hurting myself/suicide which I can’t turn off &amp; I feel I can’t turn to anyone else in real life."	1
"why the fuck do i keep thinking/dreaming about anxieties, fears, and other shit i dont want to think aboutI fucking swear to god im gonna take the other end of a hammer and sink it right into my fucking face i need release from this fucking torture

I feel like i have no control of my thoughts my brain just does whatever the fuck it wants and it wants to fucking hurt me. I keep thinking of these fears and anxieties that are so bad that I actually believe they are real when they are not. I keep grounding myself and i still cannot fucking realize that its just my head getting to me but i still CANNOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND. Then comes the intrusive thoughts that stay in my head for the rest of eternity and never go away. The only reason why i cut is because of this shit, i cant fucking get away from it and its making me go insane. It haunts my dreams to no end, within the past 5 days my dreams have all been the same awful shit. Now i cant even feel safe from my thoughts while sleeping.

"I just really want someone to talk too (15m)I have always had anxiety and depression. Recently I have been getting more and more suicidal. My gf left me and if i'm honest I don't/didn't think anyone does/will love me. We dated for around a year and a half, and then out of the blue she sent me a text saying it was over. I tried to talk to her but she told me I was gonna end up dead because I haven't asked for help. Shes so mad at me now and for the person you love so much to say the things she said. I feel so crushed. I have been looking into suicide methods for about a year now. I always thought it was comforting that I could just stop the pain ,but now I think more and more about it and i'm thinking its almost time. I guess i'm just looking for a reason to get off the edge. I'm so scared of death but I can't stand another day of trying and trying for nothing. I just don't want to be a problem anymore. To be clear I have talked to my mom who is the only person I can imagine caring about me a little. I told her for 20 minutes how much I hate myself and just want it to stop. She talked about getting me help and then forgot about it. I don't think I can do that again. It was so draining to tell her all of that for nothing. I know i'm just another kid and maybe this is all going to resolve with time but I cannot stress how much I just want a way out. I have been searching for my moms gun and when I find it that will be the night.

"Never in a million years could I see myself posting here. See no future, no alternatives, I don't want to, but I feel like I have no choice.Nobody can know who I am. Please don't try to figure it out; it's probably possible. 

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. 

I no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)

I don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. 

Tell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.

Is it part of growing up to progressively start feeling like shit? Like I just kinda feel worse like physically and more tired even though I work out, statistically in the gym I am doingn better now than I was 3 years ago, but im always tired and feel like shit ig. Also i go through like super optimistic and pessimistic mood phases, and the optimistic one is always sarcastic. Do i need to go to a doctor or do other people feel like this.	2
"Need some help in MS/LA...I'm male, and I live around the Mississippi/Lousiana border near Slidell, and I don't know what to do really...


To start off, I've had minor depression issues on and off for 14 years, but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it, same with anxiety. I've been on the meds for 11 months and I'm in worse shape than in January. Recently, it's become amplified infinitely, due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few 'mishaps' in our relationship over the years. I was completely blindsided by this, and she refuses to talk it over, do couples therapy. I'm addicted to her, and we've been together since mid-2005, before I turned 15, and we have 4 kids together, 2 who live with us (2 were adopted out early on in our relationship)


Due to all this, I've been at wits end, considering downing every bottle of pills I can find, and even had the cops and e-squad called on me earlier this week, and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not. I don't even want to be in this shape due to my kids. It pains me enough just to sit alone, bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes. 


I saw a counselor on Monday, and she said that I need to work on myself, and throughout my life, I've been told I'm too self-centered, so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore, and for psychiatric help, I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months. I've been teetering on self-committment, but I'm worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future...



Does anyone know of any psychiatric facilities that won't have me waiting a large portion of a year to be seen?"	1

"partner threatening to commit suicideAnd I feel guilty and responsible.
The thing is, I convinced my partner to go to the psychiatrist. He got prescribed meds. Everything seemed to be going well, until...
There is this boy that is my best friends for 10 years. There was never chemistry between us, we are just mates. Throughout our friendship he did some nasty things to me, but somehow we always got back.
When I started dating my partner he immediately hated my friend. I told him some bad things that the did to me in the past and it formed an image of an abuser in the head of my partner. The truth is, I should have held my emotions, but even though I tried to explain to him that it's not the case anymore, he hates the friend guy very much. He never openly told threatened me, but after every conversation we have about the friend he gets extremely suicidal. Two days ago he locked himself in the bathroom and later he told me that he held a sharp object and wanted to kill himself, he was very close. I cried like crazy and he told me that he is disappointed that the most important person for him reacts in such way, because it makes him feel like a bad person.
I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose a long time friend and I feel emotionally manipulated. I have not told anyone because I'm scared that my partner will get mad and will do something bad to himself. When I told him I feel manipulated he wanted to kill himself for being a bad person for me because he felt like psychopath and he hated himself for that. On the other hand, I distanced myself from the friend and he is angry at me for that. He doesn't understand why I did that and he feels cheated because our friendship was very important for both of us. So. Here I am alone. With everyone being angry at me, I feel constant guilt and need to do everything my partner wants me to. I love him very much and I don't want him to end himself. But I also don't want to be put in the position where I need to chose between friend or partner. I feel really sick of this all, I have no idea what to do. My partner doesn't want to go to the therapy with me. He also doesn't want to get any more psychological help. I cannot force him, it must be his decisions. I feel so alone.

Anyone has any tips on how to talk with either of them? I feel embarrased that I got myself to be so manipulated and I don't want to admit it to my friend because he will tell me to leave my partner. And I CANT live him. I would feel guilty if anything bad happens to him. I feel the responsibility for too many people at once. I want to see counselor but first I decided to do a research on the Internet and ask you on this subreddit. How to talk with suicidal people?
Is there any solution? 
This situation is just so sick. I'm afraid to tell anyone, because no one will understand. I feel so alone in this. "	1

"My disability is ruining my life, and my parents make me regret being bornNothing I do is ever enough for them because I can never do enough. I’m in too much pain. They punish me for this constantly and tell me that i need to help more. I want to help more. But I can’t. I can barely sit up some days and cry a lot from both mental and physical pain. They yell at me when I break down and can’t move. They yell at me when I don’t spend time with them even though when I’m around them I just make them feel bad and guilty. If I show the smallest bit of pain around them they start acting like they hate me.

I’m non-binary, my parents are apparently grieving my “cis” self as well. They’re transphobic all the time even though they don’t mean to be. I’ve tried telling them how much they’re hurting me but they never seem to care. They just say I’m hurting them by being non-binary and being in pain.

I can’t do a lot of the things I want to and my parents make me not even want to try since I know it’ll never be good enough. We’re starting to be a little low on cash as well.

I think maybe it’d be better if I just died. They could live normally then. I’m so tired of being treated like this. I don’t want to do it anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore.

I was just going through the motions, not even thinking stuff like ""this is the end"" or any kind of acknowledgement. First thing I remember after getting all tingly and blacking out was having random images flashing before I started to focus on what happened and realized I was lying on the floor and that I had just tried to kill myself. I don't know if was a poor not or something I did unconsciously, but I had smacked my face on something and when I calmed down enough to get to the bathroom and see what happened, I saw I have a bruise under my chin and a knot on my forehead, and when I fished around in my mouth because it was hurting, I found a chunk of my tooth. It all made me feel like shit. I had a friend who was helping me through this and I promised if it got too bad I would talk to her. But not only did I not even ask for help before it got to that point, but I didn't give her any sort of final word or anything. I feel like an asshole."	1

"the secret to happyThis world exists to cut you down and hurt you and inevitably kill you.

I tell myself ""To be happy you must give everything away until you are nothing. Your sadness and your pain and your anger IS your happiness. Hurt yourself when you feel anything but happy, hurt yourself before someone else does, hurt yourself and be happy you are in pain, be happy you are suffering, be happy you are starving, be happy you are hopeless.""

The secret to being happy is torturing yourself until you're no longer human."	1
"Nothing like starting the day with your grandpa trying to hit your mom... Fuck this, fuck it, I know he is sick, I know he has all sees things that aren't there, I know all the good things he did, but I also know he used to beat his kids even before he became sick, I know the things he did to grandma, how he keeps trying to have control over her after she died.

I literally had represeed the memories of him hitting me with a belt for making noise, I remember my mom and grandma standing between us and him beating them and am I suppose to forgive me because he bought me a plushie? He did good things but the bad things he did are the ones that haven't change, I was so fucking scare of him and we still have to put of with his shit because no one has the heart to leave him anywhere else and none of my uncles has the gut to take care of him.

We were having breakfast and he just entered the room calling my mom a bitch, a whore, telling her she's been sneaking men into our house, that she is trying to kill him, that she's been stealing from him, he tried to hit her, to choke her, and she says it's alright and that he does that because he's sick, as far as I know he's been doing that ever since she was little.

He's always been that way yet am I suppose to ignore that, I'm 17, I shouldn't worry about grandpa trying to harm us, about hidding all sharp objects and a gun from him, about him treathening to kill himself, he's the reason my mother almost killed herself when she was my age and honestly I thought about it multiple times because of him.

I'm just so fucking tired, everyone thinks we are lying, we even showed one of my uncles a video of what he did and he just laughed, I'm tired of faking being alright just to keep up with his reputation of being a good man, am I supposed to lie just because he drove me to school? 

Shit, what does it matter? Those are our bodies, nobody has slept with anyone and if that was the case so what? It doesn't affect him, I'm fucking done, if anything he is the pervert here, I remember how he entered my room when I was little exactly the moment I came out of the bath, yet he had the nerve to call a 9 year old a degenarate for being naked, dude, I was 9 and putting on clothes, he's the one who opens the door while I'm on the bathroom and nobody in this house is allowed to lock anything, he's the one who tried to take a bath with my mom, his own fucking daugther, he's the one making stories about us being around naked men and so, what the hell, I shouldn't be afraid of him watching me as I sleep, I shouldn't be afraid of him entering my room at night and doing something to me, I'm tired of this shit."	2

I've always come here hoping that maybe I can help, maybe I can say something to someone and it will give them a tiny glimmer of hope. But I never said anything. I wanted to help so much and all I could do was watch.

And now it's my turn to shout into the void, calling out to anyone who'll listen. Im asking, begging, is there anyone out there who will save me because I can't cope by myself any more. I just can't do it.

I realise there's probably not much point in saying anything since I'm being selfish. You probably shouldn't talk to me because everyone I know seems to think I'm a manipulative bitch. They call me toxic.

I don't know. I guess this was just my last chance to get help before I end it."	1
"Why not?I remember all the cool kids in my neighbourhood could jump to the 4th bar on the monkey bars and I wanted to do it so bad. I was too much of a coward to do it at 7 years old, so on my 8th birthday I decided I was finally old enough and I went to the ledge to jump. I was frozen for about 30 seconds and stepped off. I knew I was gonna do it eventually but I didn't know when. It was eating away at me for a while, until one day I had enough and just went for it. My fingers slipped and I wiped out and bruised my tailbone. It was exactly what I feared would happen. I got right back up though, and tried it again and nailed it the 2nd time. 

That was almost 15 years ago; I'm 23 now. If someone were to ask me the last time I was proud of myself it would be that day as an 8 year old. I swear to God i'm that much of a loser. 

For the past year I've wanted to just sleep forever. I'm just tired. I honestly feel that urge I had back when I was a kid to just go for it and jump - just end it all. Right now it's not even a matter of will I/Won't I. It's a matter of when.

I'm 100% sure i'm doing it, but I don't want to. Anyone else feel me on this?

My life is and is always going to be pointless and I’m never going to be good enough or be able to support myself. I’m just a burden on everyone. My bones are so brittle because I never leave my house. I have only left my house 5 or 6 times in over a year and 1/2, because thats when my ex left me and I lost my last job.

"172 reasons to keep goingI went a few years without these thoughts, but they're with me every damn day again. I've been thinking a lot about how I'd do it and what I'd say in my notes, but I'm just not selfish enough to leave my family with that pain. So I haven't.

This idea that I can still be useful to others is what is keeping me going. That I can guide others to be successful in careers, or boost their spirit, or help them monetarily. When I'm dead, that goes away, right? So, if I have a reason to live, I think it's to give others more reasons to live.

So I kept a tally this year...

112 kids introduced to STEM in the real world, taught programming, given demos, generally attempted to inspire to study technical subjects. (~80% young women)

10 college students mentored in ""social change through app dev"" projects

41 minority college freshman introduced to career options and demo'd

3 college interns directly mentored

1 lady given a job on my recommendation

1 family member helped with suicidal thoughts and taught meditation

1 friend of the same family member guided to emergency services when he attempted

3 anonymous donations to give Christmas to random families

If I were dead, that stuff wouldn't have happened. I just keep telling myself that and looking for more opportunities."	1

I've given up trying to finish my reading list; I read a sentence--sometimes a page--and then close the book. I even bought the VC Pokemon Silver thinking 'well, might as well' but I regret buying it now :(

I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, more restless than bored. I'm probably not thinking things through again--maybe the rope I'll buy won't be able to hold my weight, maybe someone will find me before I die, maybe I won't even get that window of opportunity, etc.

In terms of planning I don't have much to think about. I had one constraint at first--I didn't want my grandma to know I had killed myself--but recent events has made me realize I don't care about that anymore; my parents will probably hide it from her anyway.

I feel weird, like I'm just faking this. I've thought about suicide countless of times before but I was always sad or angry. Now I'm just... content? Like I'm not sad enough or angry enough to even think of suicide but here I am anyway.

No, I don't want to do anything about it. I know you're thinking I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't want help but I just want to leave this here like a note of some sort.

"I don’t have anything that makes life worth fighting for.I’m sitting here at a Korean BBQ restaurant on a Saturday night eating dinner by myself.
My plans fell through today - both Plan A and Plan B. As I’m sitting here trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my day, I can’t really come up with anything worthwhile. 
That’s when I started thinking about ending my life. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense to me. I hate being stuck in the same old loop. I fight tooth and nail for change, and I always end up with the same result - nothing.

"And I'm the selfish one. The asshole he calls me.Mom made me marry him at 17 in Chester, VA.  I gave him my virginity.  He gave me herpes.  We had a quick 15 minute ceremony at a lawyers office.  My honeymoon took place at the Sheraton on Midlothian tnpk.  Special....until he said he took all his gf's there.  A year later we moved in with my Grandma to save money and get a house.  At this point we were the proud owners of a ford festiva, $155 a month.  He worked at the local ford dealership.  Needless to say we couldnt move an apartment full of furniture in that micromachine car.  So he bought an f150.  $330/month.  Why did we move to my G'mas?  I went to see my cousins baby with my G'ma. He got mad and went out drinking.  Drove home down the train tracks.   I had two daughters while living in that basement.  He had 2 motorcycles and a boat and a bronco. After 5 years I got the hell out.  To the second apartment.  I got a job cleaning houses.  I bought me an $1100 1980 something mustang.  We moved into a trailer.  I bought me a new 1999 mustang.  We moved 2 more times.  I got a job driving a school bus.  I went to college inbetween.  We moved in with his mother so I could attend nursing school full time.  Big mistake.  Quit and went to respiratory school.  Moved to the east coast of Va.  He bought a bigger boat since we were on the chesapeake bay/rappahannock river.  I tried several times to buy a house, turn down after turn down.  At one point before nursing school I wanted to volunteer at the resque squad.  He wouldnt allow it.  I would be around men...at night.  So I worked in a hospital full of men.  Things that can be done in a confused patients room.  Woooo Guess who got fired and found a job working at nigh?  You guessed it.  Not me.  Effing hypocrit
My daughter turned into a holy terror.  Didnt listen.  Came and went as she wanted.  Had 2 kids I had to take care of at night.  Had to put up with her shit and the trash she brought home.  They didnt listen either.  I begged my husband to quit his job.  I needed him there with me before I killed myself to get away from the shit.  I hated to come home after work so I would stay with my other daughter at her house. We filed bankruptcy after his heart attack because he ""couldnt"" work.   Finally left the state to get away.  This summer 2019, we were close to buying a house.  Until he saw an expedition he wanted.  What was wrong with my equinox at 191 a month?  538 for the expedition.  I let it known that we would not be able to a house again.  Do you think he cared?  He wined like a damn kid until I couldnt take it and said go fucking get it.  Im living with my mother in law.  I have ALS and I'm dying.  Not quick enough.  I married the most selfish SOB Ive ever met.  I have came to the place I literally hate him.  I want to die to get away from him.
Im not perfect.  The night before we got married I was with my exboyfriend.  Who, after 27 years I found him.  I learned a lot that I didnt know was going on in his life.  I wish he would have talked to me about it.  I showed my tits to a few people.  Some got to play and kiss them.  Few years ago hubs dick stopped working due to meds.  Seems to me IF you actually loved your wife you could make lifestyle changes to get off heart meds or use other means to get your wife off.  So I think he doesnt care.  I got' caught sexting with other redditors.  That didnt go well. I was diagnosed with ALS in the morning and he bitched me out calling me everything he could that afternoon.  I guess having been given a death sentence I forgot to delete his texts.
I want a clock that tunes on the hour and to go to the mutter museum and die in my own house.  Do you think that he would do  either for me?  Nope.
I stay in my bed doing suicide searches online.
I JUST WANT TO DIE AND LEAVE THIS MISERABLE LIFE OF MINE.
I LOVE MA AND PA AND MY 2 BROTHERS
I LOVE MY DAUGHTERS EMILY AND TIFFANY.
I LOVE MY GRANDAUGHTERS PEYTON AND LUCY.

"I have called the suicide hotline and used crisis chat a few timesI am looking for a solution, not comfort. The hotline and chat have both only been able to provide comfort, which was useless for me because I have only used logic to justify suicide.


Every time I reach out is a desperate attempt to find someone else that has stumbled down a similar path towards making a real positive change in the world. One person doesn't stand a chance, nearly everything stacks up against them to make even a local change. I don't know what I could possibly say to find that kind of person anymore. I am exhausted. 

All I can see that I can do now is to serve an example to not let your dreams be dreams. I will build my plane and fly it, or die trying.

Fuck. Everything is dripping with greed. Spending my life trying to sort out alternatives and lifestyles that benefit everyone and make sense... just to have people look at me like a fucking nut. Apparently not wanting to take advantage of people is an alien concept to this world. I can't find words for the disgust it brings me.


I believe I am beyond help. I'm mostly just putting this here for myself so that I can say I tried. I don't expect a change.


It's scary stuff. I can't talk about this sort of thing because I am terrified that if who I am speaking with actually understands it, they will fall into the same conclusion I am currently at. I'm going to try not to think about it now. Not much use though, seeing as it has been on my mind every day for years. I am so tired."	1

i am not ok. ive never been diagnosed with shit because my social anxiety is so fucking stupid i cant even go to therapy, but i think i might have depression/anxiety and schizophrenia and maybe a bit of ocd but again im fucking stupid and dont know shit. every day and minute voices tell me to kill myself or kill others, i dont fucking want to do either but i cant deal with it. all of my options are out because of social anxiety. just a few minutes i was talking to my friend about (we've been friends for about 3yrs now and ive basically been their mini-therapist for the past 6mo/1y and they're literally the only person besides the people on reddit that know the shit i go through) my thoughts and shit for the past week and theyve just ignored them and talked about other stuff then i said i wanted to hang myself and they said ""i miss when you werent like this"" then said that there was no way they could help. guess it fucking confirms my hypothesis; im a fucking piece of shit unfixable garbage."	1
"i’m honestly done with this shit(throwaway account)

i’m 18

molested by mom until 13

she’s an alcoholic, pathological liar, and straight up certified piece of shit

dad suffered from drug addiction and schizophrenia and wasn’t around much

he killed him self about 8 months ago

i basically spent my entire childhood alone

my brother and sister were popular and i didn’t have friends, when their friends were over they were always mean so i’d just hide in my room

my brother grew up with living with his well-off dad (same mom,different dad) and he doesn’t understand what our mom put me and my sister through (stealing money from us, fucking our credit, calling cops on us, just being a typical alcoholic shitbag)

even my sister barely understands what i went through, for some reason my mom just decided to pick me to molest and physically abuse

i’ve only told 2 people about what i’ve been through and their the only people in my life

my sister and kayla

i met kayla in a mental hospital last november 

we were both there from friday until tuesday

we became really close in there and talked about everything to each other

we’d walk the hallways back and forth all day just talking about whatever we were thinking of at the moment

i wrote my number on a piece of paper and gave it to her, i was really nervous but she seemed excited to keep contact when we got out

the first day she got out she broke up with her emotionally abuse ex

he’d keep messaging her on different social media’s after she blocked his number/facebook/instagram

over the next 2 weeks we hung out probably 6-7 times even though we’re both busy with work all the time

she seemed to show some interest in me

she said i smelled good and she said i have pretty eyes all the time

we’d always have these moments where’d we just stare into each other’s eyes not saying anything but it wasn’t awkward at all

her ex showed up at her house one night and it’s all gone down south from there

we went from hanging out all the time and texting about our days to barely seeing or talking to each other

in the past month we’ve only hung out twice, she’s even cancelled a couple times

at first i wasn’t sure if it was him controlling her or if i was just looking too into things

today we talked on the phone for a bit, she said she’s been busy with work, school, and seeing someone

she asked me if i wanted to hang out tonight (to smoke)

everytime we’ve hung out, i’ve smoked her up, and the two times we hung out in december it was when she was out of weed

since i was busy with work i asked what she was doing tomorrow, she’s cooking dinner at her place with a friend

so now i think she’s seeing someone that not her ex and now that she’s sees how i’m such a depressed shy piece of shit that doesn’t talk about anything but his childhood problems she doesn’t really enjoy my company anymore and just wants weed out

the only time i’ve ever felt any sort of happiness is with her and now it feels like it’s all gone and i’m worse off than before

what the fuck do i do"	1
People always talk about Capitalism but never lowercase-ism 😔	2
Attractive people make me want to kill myself more.Does anyone else feel like that? Especially the one who brag about their relationship statues and all their adventures.. Just annoyingly depressing especially when you know if you tried to find a partner you get nothing but rejection coz in today's society ugly means no rights to feelings.	1
I have almost no chance of passing my geology course, meaning I will have to take an extra semester at csun. i have no clue how I will pay for it. I want to dieYeah, no matter how hard i try, I am a failure. I had a death in the family at the start of the semester which threw my life into disarray, meaning i missed a lot of assignments because I had to help my family plan the funeral as well as balance school and work, though now that job is gone. I want to die. I am nothing more than a shitty failure. I will never be a teacher, and i will never get into grad school or get my dream of being a history professor. 20 years old and i've already fucked my life over. time for me to leave	1

"Unmotivated and going insaneSo I'm an Asian student, schooling while working a part time job, which leaves me with no time for the family. They say the family would be no different without me.

Recently my mother has said that she would have rather gave birth to a pig instead of me as it would be more useful. I feel hurt. I don't know what to do. I'm trying my best to contribute. I've tried talking it out with them but they tell me that I only have work on my mind. I can barely manage my school fees with my pay and I'm on the verge of expulsion due to late payments. My father is too old to work and my mother is a housewife. 

The only reason why i haven't slit my wrists is because i know they can't do without me. But they seem to hate me or something. Help.

Im falling into depression slowly and it's taking a toll on my studies.

Final edit: You guys rock. To think that coming here would do me so much. That makes me feel slightly better, if only a bit. I'm gonna have to move out and find myself lodging and it's gonna be tougher on my wallet but I'm gonna try for a few more months."	1
It's kinda dumb that girls have to pay for literally existing Like imagine having to pay for something that happens constantly and it's something you can't control. Thank you society very cool 😎	2
Why can't i have good things?My best friend was depressed, after going to doctor, and talking a few meds, i saw her smile, it was so genuine, i cried, like literally. I wonder why, then i realized, i want to have that kind of smile too,  but how can i do that,  even if i drink hundreds or thousands of meds, when the people around me are always pulling me down, it's impossible. Im so tired. 	1
there was this tiktok that said to comment and if your comment had no replies in 24hrs you’d get a free crewneck and it’s been 7hrs and ya girl’s replies are still crystal clean 🥴🥴 i have an alarm set for noon tomorrow and if i pull this off i’ll post what i got 😗👍	2
The only thing that's keeping me from killing myself is my incomplete last wish.I don't even know if I want to complete it anymore. It'd be better in the grand scheme of things, but my mind cannot comprehend either of the outcomes. Only thing I know is that I'm holding back on it for now because its something that once done, will leave me completely and utterly purposeless.	1
"Christmas... MDD is a Fucking MonsterIt's very hard for me to do almost anything and even harder to feel good about anything. Someone I know that has control over me is being a dick and he really is not making me feel better. People say ""you have such a good life"", if I'm not happy it doesn't even matter. 

I want to do so much, but there's something in me that pushes me away from doing it and I really want to know what it is.

This comes down to watching fucking TV. I have so much regret it alone just makes me want to leave.

A bit of info: 

I'm 19

I never had a drivers license or a job because my parents don't think it's good idea right now.

I been asking for OT (for an other disability) and  other things for like two years and they are still ""working on it.""

I never had friends or been on a date.

I had leave school for a while and I'm getting my GED.

I will go to college if I live long enough.

Just going out or being around people has NEVER helped me make friends.

I went to Girl Scouts for seven years.

I want to learn to talk to people, like at all.

I am bit psychotic.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I’m done trying, I’m just a huge drain on everyoneI’ve come to my breaking point of even trying anymore, these past few months have pushed me past to the point of no return. It all started last year when I was let go from a well paying job, I was unemployed for months draining all my savings while unemployment paid me little to nothing. I applied to so many jobs that I was hopeful for only to get rejection after rejection. I had finally got a job months later but the pay was just enough to get me by month to month. I was struggling but was making it work. Then that job contract recently ended prematurely and I am back on unemployment with little to no savings and not getting enough to pay my bills per month. I am constantly asking my dad to bail me out of going into more debt and getting evicted every month and this month the debt has just piled up and don’t have enough to pay my rent or even buy food. I have been again getting rejection after rejection on jobs and it’s made me realize I’m not as good as I thought I was. The past 10 years of my life working and building up my resume has just been a waste of time it seems. I have an interview today with a job, but if I get rejected on this one then I am just going to end it. I can’t keep asking my dad for money, I’m about to be 30 and can’t even be a proper adult living independently. This is my final option, either I am offered that job or I end it all to save the financial drain I am causing everyone. Sure they will be sad I did it and angry I didn’t ask for more help, but constantly asking for financial help is the bigger drain. Sorry to everyone that I’m going to hurt by doing this and sorry to all my friends and family. I can’t do this anymore and have zero will to live past this. Goodbye everyone.	1
"Everyone says I've been looking more animated and happier recentlyMany people have told me they think the medicine is working and I seem happier, but I feel so much worse. All I can think about is killing myself. Every time I talk to my psychologist or psychiatrist I feel 100 times worse. But if I stop going I'll just be quitting another thing, and it will scare my mom.

I have been thinking about confronting my mom about my suicide, and trying to get her not to be as upset about it if possible. I don't think I could ever make her not be sad about it, but I'm hoping maybe I could get her to consider not killing herself because of me."	1
Man valentines was great Ik I already posted about this but it was beautiful seeing all these people in love and making each other happy. Cheers Saint Valentine’s	2
I’m losing reasons to live, day after dayI don’t even know where to start. I don’t want to live anymore, and the only thing stopping me from committing suicide is the pain and chance I’ll end up crippled. I don’t even care about my family anymore. It’s been this way for a while. Every time I interact with them they put me down in ways they don’t even understand. My father is disappointed in me for not constantly working with him, and my mother is constantly on my ass about work. My girlfriend left me for her best friend a few months back, and she spread lies about me saying I beat her, and now I can’t trust anyone. I don’t feel like I can love anyone, as a matter of fact. I feel only lust for others and that’s it. I see myself as a terrible person. I think things no one should. I think terrible things. I say rude things that no one should say. And yet here I am, pitying myself. I truly don’t deserve to live.	1
I just pissed all over my leg and foot. I was at the toilet to pee and my pee went to the right instead of straight and it hit my leg and my sock is now wet.	2
I need to talk to someoneIt's been a long time. I need help. It's so silly. Getting so bent over a woman. For the longest time I didn't think I could feel anything and that was how I would survive. That is how I could beat depression. Then I fell in love. I had good and bad days but they were always better because of her. Now I think she is gone, and here I sit alone again with only my hate to keep me company.	1
suicidehonestly i’m just in so much pain i’ve looked everywhere for an answer but i can’t find one	1
"2 years ago I posted here and now I'm back.I posted here 2 years ago when it was almost my bday and I was freaking out. I think I also called the suicide hot line. Well 2 years of trying by ass off to be better at life and it's got worse. 
Now I'm almost 30. In April I will be. Since then I have had 2 jobs thinking that was the problem. Nope. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't but I think it's me. Went from one gob to the same one different company, same shit happened. So I switch it up and go to a different job entirely. Kinda. Gas station manager to manager of a beauty store. 
Same shit. Under paid for all the work I do with no help and then I get in trouble for things that are literally NOTHING to do with me. Super long stories that I'm not going to get into. Each time I left because I put my mental health before a shirt retail job. 
Any way now I'm lost and don't know what to do. Earlier I tried to post on financial help sub and got bombarded with so many horrible things that now I'm super right back into holy shit just kill you self mode. 
I've been told every thing I could possibly to do improve my life and career and I have tried everything thing. 
Right now I just want to hear about the good that can happen in life. I just need some hope I guess. If I could drink I would just drink and pass out and wake up and do it all over again like a zombie that I was for years and years in my early 20s. Now I have an ulcer and can't drink, and can't afford any of the drugs that I want to do to get me through this. 
I'm hoping maybe I can just read something to make me smile and give a little hope that maybe, just maybe something good will happen to me that will give me a reason to live. "	1
"The broken birdWhere do the broken birds go when their wings won't fly anymore.

I look and look for broken birds but I can't find anymore.

Broken birds aren't free, they are trapped on the shore.

Broken birds don't speak, their beaks don't work anymore.

Look at that lazy bird the other birds chirp.
That lazy bird sits on the ground and doesn't even work.

The other birds laugh and the other birds play.

Little do they know, they won't see the broken bird again after today.

But it was I who liked the broken bird so I ask you please say,

Where is the broken bird so I may have a friend today."	1
I’m trying to not let gender dysphoria make me suicidal again, but I’m really struggling. Help?I’m doing everything that I feel safe enough to do to combat it, since my parents aren’t too accepting of me. I spend a lot of time talking with people who refer to me as my preferred gender and name. But it’s still really hard. It’s just eating me inside. Certain parts are hard to ignore and puberty is making everything that much worse. My current therapist isn’t really helping that much, and he knows he’s not qualified to deal with gender dysphoria. But insurance won’t cover a gender therapist. I have to help my parents pay for it. I don’t have the money yet, but I’m another two weeks I should. But still, I’m really scared it’s going to get worse and I’m going to seriously hurt myself. Help me please.	1
Potentially dumb question If you’re 18, is it bad to have a crush on someone who is still 17?	2

"If only there were convenient tools for suicide...If only I had a gun. If only I had a convenient cliff I could drive my car off of without hurting anyone else. If only I had a sharp enough hunting knife. If only, if only. 

I get so tired of being triggered by the same thing that repeats itself. I'm so tired of being patient and kind and understanding and asking nicely when all I get in return is the same defensiveness and anger. I finally started escalating in return, and now the escalation hits immediately. I shout and curse. I say nasty things. I am emulating the out-of-control behavior of the abuser that made my life hell. And I feel gaslighted into it. 

I read a title of a narc mom in a narc sub saying ""i wish I had aborted you"" and I thought that's as nasty as something I might say to my partner in my peak anger and vindictiveness. And now I just want to end myself before I get any worse. I have therapists and I've made so much progress but I hate what I become when I'm triggered again and again by the same condescending reaction to my best efforts. "	1
"whats better family knowing or suspecting?long story short.

shit live, not happy, making everyone else unhappy, no one checks in etc etc feeling sorry for myself and really kinda done with it all.

also i kinda see it as jumping in front of a car to save my families life...they WILL be better off without me for sure....i was told today that i scare them even though i have never touched them...

anyway to the point sorry...

is it better for them (2 kids and wife) if they know it was suicide or is it better just to smash my car into a wall at 120km/ph...

im leaning towards the car...as it will make payout by the insurers more likely and they may guess but not know for sure which i think would be more beneficial for the kids to get over. the wife could even say it was an accident and they don't need to know.

the only reason an overdose seem better would be the comfort but then 120 into a wall wouldn't last long...

"14 MonthsI can't believe it's 2013. My depression began at the end of 2011. In an attempt to get better I've been seeing a psychiatrist 2-4 times per month, and for a stretch of six months I met with both a psychologist and a life coach. 

With my doctor's help I've tried various cocktails of Zoloft, Lexapro, Abilify, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Adderall and Ativan. None have helped my depression in a significant way. I've leaned on friends and family for support, improved my diet, and learned mindfulness meditation. (But I must admit I was never able to stick to the meditation for more than a week at a time.)

In short, I spent the last 14 months trying to get rid of my depression, but here I am tonight on SuicideWatch feeling as bad as I've ever felt.

I attempted to take my life last year, but my kidneys and liver were stronger than I gave them credit for. If I try again it will be with the help of the Golden Gate Bridge, which I'm told is 99% effective.

I know that if I continue to fight there's still a chance my depression would go away and I could end up happy again. The odds of this happening lie somewhere between 0 and 100%. But I also know that if I end my life the chances of the pain ending are 100%, and I won't be around to regret it. I suppose that's the tautology of suicide. Nobody who has killed themself has ever regretted it.

I'm practically convinced that ending my life is the better of my two options. The downside of course is the emotional toll it would take on my friends and family. But I counter that with the emotional and financial toll I'm already taking and would continue to take on them in the future.

Although I'm pretty convinced of my decision, I obviously haven't committed to it since I'm here asking for help. Your advice will be appreciated."	1
Gone, I couldn't murder your promise right before my eyes, the revolutions of my psychosis kept me out of the way.Once inside, all I hold is ash. Fail, suppressing every feeling; I'm in so much pain. I have every fucking right to hate you, I can't take it. The hardest part was knowing I could never be you, now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you. Who are you to me? Who am I to you? Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence? By default, you are my only link to the outside psychosomatic suicide. Where were you when I was down, can you show me a way to face everyday with this face? When I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe, I see you fucking me and I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate. The one and only answer so much for memories, I want to dress in your insecurities and be the perfect you. I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe, here we go, the ultimate irony.	1
I have less than 5 hours to write an essay I had a week to do Wish me luck. My procrastination is so silly. I have to cite it as well. HAHAHAH IM SO FUCKING DUMB.	2
Idk if I can say this, but I hope I can for the lols. And to express how I feel! I feel asleep while masturbating last night, and don’t have another chance to go until after school today. That’s like 9+ hours! Also I haven’t fallen asleep while doing that in a long time!	2
"I do nothing but hurt people.  Sorry in advance for the novel...

I have no family and no friends whom I do not hurt.  I'm a selfish bitch and I honestly feel that I would be doing a service to the world if I expunge myself from it.  To allow myself, as destructive as I am, to continue to live would be selfish.

Today was my breaking point.  The two people I respect and look up to the most in the entire world I have hurt and disappointed, and they are upset with me and I cannot take it anymore.  They are my research advisors, (they are married), and I loved them as dearly as a daughter would love her parents (I always wanted parents, but I've been alone my whole life, save for a meth-addicted father who sold my body to his friends for drug money when I was 13-14 and is now in prison).  

Recently, I was taken advantage of by an old high school friend and I've been struggling emotionally since that night. Two days ago, I told one of them that I was really anxious and a bit vulnerable, but yesterday he completely snapped at me (for what I perceive as no real reason - it was a miscommunication).  I left the lab in tears, but I returned today because I do have work to do.  However, when I arrived my other advisor took me aside and told me that I'm too emotional and that I have been causing stress to her husband, whom I idolize.

And two days ago, I made on of my friends cry.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take the fact that I'm so self-absorbed I hurt everyone, EVERY ONE I care about.  I can't stand myself.

I am truly convinced at this point that getting over my fear of death would be the right thing to do.  "	1
"Not sure if i need helpHello, i'm a 30 yo french dude, i've been depressed since i have like-8 yo cause of many things that i won't explain here.

When i was with here i was happy, i put my depression away to be here for her, but now, everything is like before but like 1000x. I've been in hospital 3 times cause of od, suicide attempt, and one time in psychiatric clinical.

Everyday when i wake up the first thing that cross my mind is to blow my head open.. i think i have to talk, i'm not sure.. i don't talk about it to my friends, and don't post a lot on reddit, just now i feel that i'll end this life really soon..

I hate looking at myselfI hate looking at myself in the mirror. I don't wanna see myself. I just feel like I am a piece of crap, a horrible person. I have made the worse mistakes in my life and I will not be forgiven. I am a good mother, a really good mother but I don't want to lose my kids. I don't feel my days, I can't even be happy about my days. I always just looking for the next thing, I cannot be thankful for what I've got. I just feel I need to run away and teach myself. Everyone is trying to tell me how and what to do and I can't do this anymore. I want to go somewhere and get away from everything. I need help...	1
"I can't force myself to care anymoreSorry if this doesn't make sense, my memories from the last few months are a little broken. Can't really piece it together too well.  


A little over 7 months ago, I broke up with my long term highschool girlfriend in search of a more fulfilling life. When we got together, she didn't want me smoking weed anymore, so I stopped. I was a pothead of a sort, so this made me a little sad, but I decided it was worth it. So naturally, when we broke up, I started smoking again. What else should a highschool senior be doing? I smoked every single day for about 7 months, trying all sorts of new drugs along the way. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Opiates. Shrooms. LSD. MDMA. Cocaine. All sorts of fun stuff. I thought that they would give me a new perspective on life, but they only left me as a shell of the person I used to be. I graduated high school about 3 months after I broke up with her, and that's when my drug use really took off. I chose to attend college about 300 miles away from my hometown in an effort to start anew, to be a different person. But now, all I am is alone. I live in a huge city with no money, I'm on the verge of failing some important classes, and have nothing left. All I want is to not be me anymore. I don't want to be anyone. I just want to be nothing. The more and more that I wonder what else I could have been, the more and more it all hurts. All the cries for help, all the lonely nights, all the account overdrawal emails and antidepressants that never worked, they all contributed to who I am as a person today. I've tried to blame people for creating the monster that I am, but the only person there is to blame is me. I'm my own Dr. Frankenstein. After I tried to kill myself, I thought it best to seek out a therapist, and maybe some antidepressant medication. Therapy doesn't do jack shit, and the only thing I have to thank my medication for is my now nonexistent sex drive. Life is so fucking bland, and christ, it's fucking killing me. "	1

I just realized that my dad (45) is going to die in 20-30 years :(((( Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
I finally tried to end itI feel like there’s just no point to me being here anymore. I never asked to exist. Everything just keeps piling up and I’m so tired. I gave in a few days ago and tried to hang myself. I ended up panicking and just crying in bed instead. Everyday hurts to be here. I’m going to lose the one person that I’m staying alive for and I’m scared. I’ve given up on the whole “things will get better” saying. Every time I think that things are looking up I get hit by everything that could go wrong. I’m really tired of all of this. My depression just keeps getting worse. I’m done.	1
I'm sitting here with pills and alcohol. I need help.I need some help. I don't know what kind of help I need. I'm 22 years old and live at home. I quit my job and I don't have another job lined up. I used to have so many goals and aspirations. But last year when I tried to kill myself, all my goals went away. And now I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I have no drive to keep going. I don't know what to do. 	1
"Turd already starving myself. I hope it will succeed this timeI already almost starved myself a few years ago. I was hospitalized because my blood sugar was low enough to be deadly. Never completed high school, skipped most days in elementary and middle school, never had ONE friend, kissless handholdless hugless virgin, depressed, PDD-NOS, learning disability, probably schizoid personality disorder, had horrible parents, and have wanted to die for a DECADE now.

Tell me normies, why should I bother trying when life is completely unfair and I never stood a chance of living a happy existence? What reason, what false hope do you have to offer, to convince me not to slowly starve myself until this awful life ends."	1

"i dont want tips on how to get women you fucking dongI already know that I'll never ever, not in a 100 lives, not in a million years, not even after will a girl ever like me. And it seems like I'm the only one who believes that. Like I'm crazy? I mean I guess I am, but this is just fact. Straight up fact. I cannot and will not be loved. I wasn't meant to be loved, I wasn't to have companionship, I wasn't meant to be appreciated. So \*\*\*STOP\*\*\* giving me advice on how I should get women because guess what I've tried literally everything I could to better myself and my life both for myself and some hypothetical future partner. But it did absolutely fuck all. 

I was given this life by whatever greater being exists just to suffer. I'm ashamed and tired of being so hurt. In so much agonizing pain. 

I started out thinking I'd write this with some sense of nihilistic wit, but the tears are finally welling up again. I cant live this life. I cant stand so much pain and torture. I'm sorry, but this is too much, and to even think that this is all it'll ever be is more than enough reason for me to shoot myself right now. So that's what I'm gonna do. Fuck."	1
"WROTE MY SUICIDE NOTE ON SATURDAYI'm 30 years old and have been feeling hopeless about my health and how it has been affecting my life. I've been having problems for years. I just had a part of my skull removed 2 weeks ago because of a skull tumor and now I'm also having intestinal pain again that I haven't had for years. Haven't been able to work and have no income and feeling like I have nothing and I am ready to go back to nothing...I've lost everything because of this over the last 2 years even though I tried to keep healthcare but I feel like the government wants people like me to die and not be a drain on the state.  

All I have left is a bunch of mental disorders making it darker and darker every day: AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social anxiety, Body Dysmorphic Disorder &amp; ADD.

I wrote my suicide note on Saturday and was going to hang myself even though that's not my  preferred ""plan"". Just seems so easy. Made it to today with the help of my family and my partner and I have an appointment with my Neurologist at 1:00PM. I hope I don't have to go back to the mental hospital because I cannot do that again. I wanted more out of life than constant physical and emotional pain"	1

We have 4 cupboards with food in, 3 are locked,

She asked me to make her a drink, I was busy in a heist in GTA which she saw so I said ""Not right now, I'm a tad busy"" If she had waited 5 minutes I would of been able to, Her response was, ""Fine I'll do it myself""   
She then told her boyfriend who she thinks is my role model (he isn't he's a lazy fuck and does fuckall apart from go to work, come home and play music loudly) I am left to do things, such as, Cleaning the house, Washing up, I've started to abandon them due to my depression which they just scream at me more, Anyway They had a go at me because I ""refused"" to make her a drink, It was a question not a demand, I can say no. I just lost it and walked off, after her boyfriend said ""If you do fuck all you don't get fed"" my simple response was ""fine by me, but not by any child services,"" She told me not to walk off, And that she couldn't handle me, so my response to that was, ""You know what I can't handle you, None of our family can, Why the fuck do you think they left us after your antics back in france"" (She complained so fucking much her dad told her to grow up)

"Just a random rant about life and death and wanting to die idk I just can't help myself but feel like... Indifferent, I'm just so apathetic to basically everything, and if there's something that makes me laugh or feel happy then it gets worse because i have to feel nothing again and that's bad.

I don't want to kill myself, but the idea of dying isn't so bad, like by something you can't control, I probably don't have the guts to do it myself and I lost my train of thought lol, brainstorming this is a shitty idea but why not.

So basically something like dying while sleeping, at least a ""peaceful"" death might not seem to bad, I know there are people who love me and all that but I don't feel much, I try liking people too, but after all the times I was rejected, I can't bring myself to love anyone or simply I haven't met her yet, even if I don't know if that's gonna happen.

Don't worry it's not a goodbye note or some shit like that, it's just a teen ranting while being a little bit sad, I keep hoping that it's a phase but the more I live the more I think I'm lying to me, but I truly hope it will pass"	2

homicidewatch is empty. I'm also suicidal, but I think the former is more a concern now. Questions...I'd prefer if an actual psychologist/-iatrist/hospital employee/doctor/etc. answer this, but any help or support is appreciated. See my post history for more info. What would happen if I checked myself into the hospital for being homicidal? I.e. I'm not really an insane person, just severely depressed/enraged and in a completely intolerable situation that makes me feel this way towards the person I live with. I don't really have anywhere else to go (not much money.) I've asked my shrink before (not seeing her again until a few days from now,) but I forgot what she said, and I feel like she may have sugarcoated it anyway to make me more likely to go. Obviously, I don't want to be locked up forever, but the truth is that, unless the circumstances change, I'm probably not going to stop feeling this way, so as soon as/if they release me, I'll be just as dangerous as I am now. Also, I have insurance but ER bills are still insane (been before for different reasons.) As of this moment, I'm not totally off the wall, but I feel that way for a good amount of the day, every day and I don't see how it's going to get any better. Would a knowledgeable person educate me as to what would happen? ALSO, someone I know with a ton of mutual friends works in the ER of one of the hospitals in town. It's the one farther away, but I would NOT want to be transferred there. I think my shrink is affiliated with them, though. I'm sure I can find these answers anywhere on the internet, but I'd like the support here anyway. Thanks.	1

"Might kill myself before my bf sees me irl.Fuck. I’m scared and i don’t know what to do.. I feel ugly as all hell and according to my friend my online bf is attractive. And me well i’m not the prettiest cookie in the fucking basket. This is so stressful omg.. We both don’t know what we look like because we haven’t exchanged pictures yet but we started dating because of each other’s personalities. So he could be ugly too but from how things sound he looks good. A lot of girls want him and have a crush on him but i can’t really say the same for myself and that’s telling. He’s sweet and I love him so much but i’m just scared he won’t be interested when we start seeing each others faces. 

I want to believe looks don’t matter but i’m told left and right they do matter, no matter how much we believe they don’t. I’ve even heard that looks effect every aspect of your life and that’s a big yikes for me and explains some things lol. Starting to believe that more and more as time goes on because of how im being treated and how i look. I’m so anxious and scared because he’s talking about seeing me but i’m not ready! I don’t even look alright at all and i can do the bare minimum with myself and i’m just starting to work with my own hair so yeah i look like shit a lot of the times. This is also very nerve wracking for me because i’ve never had a serious relationship like this. We’ve only been together for a short amount of time but he was willing to spend 100 dollars on me and he already sent me gifts this christmas.

I don’t know what the hell he’s expecting me to look like but lord knows i don’t look like a victorious secret model lol. Ugh.. I’m just so afraid he’s going to be let down when he sees me for the first time. I barley even know how to do makeup or style my hair in a cute style. I’m set so fucking far back in life compared to me pears and it hurts. I hope i don’t get banned for saying this but i think to myself

 “𝚆𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚒𝚏 𝙸 𝚎𝚗𝚍𝚎𝚍 𝚖𝚢 𝚕𝚒𝚏𝚎 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 𝚗𝚘𝚠? 𝙷𝚒𝚜 𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚕 𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚐𝚎 𝚘𝚏 𝚖𝚎 𝚠𝚘𝚗’𝚝 𝚋𝚎 𝚏𝚞𝚌𝚔𝚎𝚍 𝚞𝚙 𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚊𝚞𝚜𝚎 𝚑𝚎’𝚕𝚕 𝚗𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠 𝚠𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚒 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔𝚎𝚍 𝚕𝚒𝚔𝚎 𝚞𝚗𝚕𝚎𝚜𝚜 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚜𝚑𝚘𝚠𝚜 𝚑𝚒𝚖” 

But then i think back to myself 

 “𝙱𝚊𝚍 𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚊.. 𝙸𝚏 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚍𝚘𝚎𝚜 𝚜𝚑𝚘𝚠 𝚑𝚒𝚖 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚢 𝚖𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 𝚙𝚒𝚌𝚔 𝚊 𝚙𝚒𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎 𝚒 𝚊𝚋𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚕𝚢 𝚑𝚊𝚝𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚜𝚑𝚘𝚠 𝚑𝚒𝚖 𝚖𝚢 𝚏𝚊𝚌𝚎. 𝚆𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚒𝚏 𝚒𝚗𝚜𝚒𝚍𝚎 𝚑𝚎 𝚠𝚘𝚗’𝚝 𝚋𝚎 𝚊𝚜 𝚜𝚊𝚍 𝚊𝚜 𝚑𝚎 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚋𝚎𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚎 𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚊𝚞𝚜𝚎 𝚑𝚎 𝚜𝚊𝚠 𝚑𝚘𝚠 𝚒 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔𝚎𝚍 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚒𝚝 𝚠𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚋𝚎 𝚑𝚊𝚛𝚍𝚎𝚛 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚑𝚒𝚖 𝚝𝚘 𝚝𝚎𝚕𝚕 𝚖𝚎 𝚑𝚎’𝚜 𝚗𝚘𝚠 𝚒𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚍 𝚒𝚗 𝚖𝚎 𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚊𝚞𝚜𝚎 𝚘𝚏 𝚖𝚢 𝚕𝚘𝚘𝚔𝚜? “

Now i know he wouldn’t say those things or even want to think of it but i’m afraid he’ll start thinking that deep down, one of his guilty thoughts and because of that he wants to erase me from his mind. This all sounds real messed up but these are serious thoughts i have with myself. 

Everyday i feel like i’m becoming more of a shallow shell focusing on my looks and nothing else. It’s consuming me and my time and i waste so much time in the day having panic attacks when i look in the mirror and then get motivated to change myself and then freak out again because i look terrible. And now the feeling is 10x because i have a boyfriend and i have to at least meet a certain standard. I feel so hopeless..

At first i was so happy and content with being with him but then the fear began setting in as soon as i realized how i looked. Fml."	1
"I don't even know why I'm posting here.I found this sub yesterday. And I started reading. And I started crying. And haven't stopped. I turned 21 about 6 weeks ago. I never thought I'd live to see this day. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 18. I never tried it again. I sought help. Got therapy. Was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Became a well-rounded and balanced individual. I can control my schizophrenia so well I only need the drugs on a bad day. 

Spring break was last week. I spent 90% of it curled up in the fetal position on my bed. I didn't move. I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I didn't speak. I've realized that no matter how happy I seem on the outside, I'm just a hollow, empty shell. There's nothing to me anymore. I don't care about life. I don't care about anything. I remembered what it was like to want to die. 

So I started listing reasons. 

I hate myself. I always have. I find myself annoying, obnoxious and insufferable. How I have friends (and willing friends) I will never understand. I'm too loud. Too boyish. Too dumb. I drive people away because I complain. About everything. I'm awkward. I suck at living. I'm incredibly irresponsible. I can't even keep my school work straight. I can't keep my life organised. I'm so afraid to move out of my parents house and be on my own. I don't even know that I can function as a member of society. I can barely keep my minimum wage job. I can't even keep myself on track to lose weight for my health. It makes me find myself so completely awful and unattractive that I can't even look at myself. I hate that I don't even have any guts. See, there's this guy I've been friends with for a while now. Before this downward spiral I've hit, he made me feel things I'd never felt for anyway. I fell in love with him in a very real way. But I don't have the guts to even tell him that I'm romantically attracted to him, let alone how deep my feelings have gotten. Even if I did, there would be no point. Who could love someone so pathetic? Who could find someone that looks like me even remotely attractive? Either way, I'm fairly certain I've driven him away, too. And then there's all the financial problems with student loans. And my parents relationship. No matter what I do, I'm always the cause of their fights. I'm fairly certain that everyone's lives would improve without me.

I just don't know anymore. What's the point on pushing through this? I've had these feelings for years and nothing has EVER gotten better, even with my therapist, anti-depressants, even attempting this before. Maybe I should have died a long time ago. Maybe I shouldn't have even been born. 

That's not to say I won't be missed. Of course I would. I know I would devastate so many people if I took myself away from them. That's the only thing that's stopping me, and I'm so close to it not even mattering anymore. I would be at peace. Isn't that what would matter? It's incredibly selfish, I know. But...why am I still forcing myself through a life I'm not even living anymore?"	1

"I have the most disgusting personality out of everyoneI am a sober teetotal brit.  Drunk Brits are being sensible and having fun in pubs after more than 20 pints while the preachy teetotal subhumans are spitting in other people's faces, yelling at managers because their food wasn't healthy enough, and going on about how it's healthy to not smoke.

I am a disgusting piece or shit for not drinking, smoking or eating food that tastes GOOD.  I am a preachy fucking degenerate.  People like me cough in people's faces while telling ACTUAL HUMANS off for throwing up and getting others to hold their hair back like most sensible British people.  I don't deserve to be British. 

Being a clean eater most of the time makes me a gross asshole.  It is impossible to change my personality and to get rid of these VILE habits that make me an obnoxious dangerous asshole to other people.

If I can't change my personality to enjoy throwing up while drunk in public, smoking and eating junk food most of the time, by tomorrow, I am going to end my life.  I NEED TO be a good sensible safe person and not some disgusting freak.  People who don't drink, smoke or eat junk food are degenerates will be the main cause of the second wave of coronavirus in this country."	1

Anyways, I have been wondering if the Nerf Dart Tag series. the whole gimic of velcro-tipped darts is a really fun idea,as the darts will stay in on the vests and we can easily confirm if the darts landed on the target or not. it has been a majpr part of my childhood, amd seeing the 50th amniversary of nerf brought us the icon series, releasing fan favourite n-strike blasters such as the stampede andthe longshot, would there be still a chance for it to come back?

"Flash Archive Porn Review You may have saw my post a little earlier, but here's some background if you haven't. Earlier today I downloaded Flashpoint because Adobe Flash is shutting down later this year and I wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games I played as a kid. Turns out that while it does have what I wanted there's a little more on top; **flash porn**. Most of these are ""games"", games in quotations because really, they're just animations that I can control the speed of. One thing I noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn. If you're not into that then Flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material. I would have to guess about 65% of the porn is actually yiff. Like I said, not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that, and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews. The only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on, no tags or thumbnails included. This means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess, but it's also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork. However, most of what isn't furry shit is low quality, which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000's. With all that said, I did end up finding something to nut to, and yes it was yiff, not afraid to admit that.

Overall, I would give using Flashpoint a 6/10 as a source of fap material. It's not practical for your everyday fap, but if you're looking to spice things up and suprise yourself a little it's worth checking out"	2
"So guys I screwed up last night and the consequences happened today So this happened last night, I was is the mood to pleasure myself, but I didn't have any lotion near me, so I ran to the bathroom to see if there was any, and yes there was. So I pumped a little bit onto my hand, and went back to my bedroom. I finished up, watched some YouTube and went to bed.

Now I wake up this morning, with my penis on fire, it hurt so bad. So I went to the bathroom to take a shower, it helped a little bit, but not enough to stop the hellfire that was going on. 

I checked the lotion I had used, it's face wash lotion for your skin it has hyaluronic, which is meant to dry out the skin. Of course the moron I am used it to to jerk off, and now I'm paying for my consequences. 

I now have it on ice which is helping enough to where I can type this without issue.

TL;DR: I used face wash lotion to jerk off, now my penis is on fire."	2

I struggle to get out of bed on a lot of days because of how overwhelming the suicidal thoughts are (sometimes when I wake up I stay in bed for 3-4 hours before getting out of bed). Everyday when I try to do my uni work, I am unable to work for long periods of time because of the anxiety/suicidal thoughts which I experience, and because of this I end up having to catch up on my work later at night, so I end up going to bed at \~ 5 am every morning. My sleep schedule is awful because of this.

I find it really hard to interact with others (whether in person or online) because I always get really paranoid that I might unintentionally do something that might upset them.

I am seeing a therapist about it, and I am trying to do the 'homework tasks' he gives me every week, but I am not seeing any improvement. I am also taking medication, I have not noticed any improvement from that either.

I also tried ERP with an OCD group program a few months ago, and throughout the group program the ERP was working and I was somewhat hopeful, but the day after the program finished all of the progress I had made instantly reversed and all of the worries I had came back and I was unable to do the exposures anymore (I don't know why this happened).

I don't really see the point of anything anymore. I'm just a leech who is a burden on others and makes their lives worse. I don't contribute anything positive to society.

I often find it hard to do the homework tasks that my therapist gives me because I am constantly in a low mood and I have zero motivation. And even though I try my best to do the homework tasks, I don't really see the point of doing them, I feel like no matter how hard I try I will never get better. My worries and low mood get in the way of everything I do, and that includes all the effort I put in to try and improve my situation.

A few weeks ago, I was obsessing over the stuff I described in the post I linked, and it got particularly overwhelming on that day and I did not know what to do, and I tried to kill myself. It didn’t work (obviously) and now I am really upset because I feel like I might have to stay one this Earth and be miserable and anxious for many decades to come. Suicide felt like my last option and since that failed, I don’t know what to do.

When I am feeling super anxious/depressed/suicidal, nothing can calm me down (including the things I wrote down on the safety plan I made with my therapist). I am tempted to call/message a friend when I feel this way, but after the thing I described in the linked post, I always feel like I am a burden on others when I talk to them about this stuff.

I feel so lonely all the time, but when I talk to either, either in person or online, I constantly get anxious, and when I see how I discussed in the earlier post I linked (again, either in person or online), I have a really bad anxiety attack and I feel suicidal and I can’t deal with it properly. So I feel super lonely but I am too scared to talk to other people. I am pretty sure that nobody gives a fuck about me, and I don’t blame them because I truly am a fucking loser.

I just don’t want to be here anymore. The constant low moods, loneliness and anxiety I experience everyday is unbearable. I can’t take it anymore."	1

"How I skipped online school and got away with it. So where I'm from, some students( including me) still have to do online school because there is still a pretty big number of COVID-19 cases in my area. The thing is, at my highschool we are still forced to do EVERY class we did when we were going to school, including P.E( even tho some of us barely have the room to do it).

 I'm really bad at P.E, and today we had to do push ups, and I can't do push ups to save my life, so I decided that I wouldn't go to P.E class today. Now, if I simply didn't join the online meeting I would get in trouble, so I needed to come up with an excuse. I couldn't just come out with a simple one like ""I was sick"" or ""I needed to go to the dentist"" because this was not the first time I didn't join a P.E meeting and the professor would figure out I'm BS-ing. So I needed to come up with a plan. 

I wear braces, and I go to the dentist at least once a month for a monthly check, and everytime I go, they give me a little ticket with the date of the next appointment. For exemple, in January they gave me a ticket saying ""23 february 14:15""(I live in Europe). And guess what I thought of. If only I could write over that 23 a 17 without  my P.E teacher realising that I wrote over it, go to the dentist, give a photo of me at the dentist and a photo with the little falsified locket to the teacher so that I have ""proof"" that I really went to the dentist, I could get away with it. 

So that's exactly what I did. I wrote 17 over 23, it wasnt perfect but it didn't needed to be, I changed, washed my teeth( so that I would really feel in character) and went to the dentist. Now I didn't go in the dentist's cabinet, that would have been too much, but I went outside of it and photographed it. I also photographed the ticket, but I left a little bit of it outside the photo, mostly the part where it said ""17"" because I figured if the teacher saw that I went to the dentist, and saw the ticket, he wouldn't ask why a little part of the ticket was missing. I already went too far, if he wasnt already satisfied with this, then I don't know what I could have gone. 

And then I went back home. Ironically, on my way back home, I ran into another classmate who also missed P.E because she went to the dentist, but she was telling the truth. I showed her my little trick and she couldn't believe that I went that far just to miss P.E. The teacher didn't respond to my message and the 2 photos, but he also didn't respond to the message of my other classmate saying she went to the dentist, so that means that he believes me, or at least that now both of us are in the same boat.

In conclusion, I don't really recommend doing what I did, but I'm very socially anxious and I don't like people watching me doing things that I'm horrible at( like pushups) at all. I feel like everyone is looking at me even though I'm sure most of them are also having a lot of trouble with it, too. But Chaotic Good does what Chaotic Good does, and here I am.

"im literally just donegirlfriend of two years broke up with me end of april, non stop thinking about her since, talking almost every day since just trying to get a chance but i'm not worth it of course.  my life was shit before i met her, she was the only thing that ever mattered to me.  She was the only person who could make me happy.

I know its a breakup up yada yada yada every one goes through it theres other people out there. i don't care. I have no doubt in my mind i can find another girl, but i simply don't want to, i don't care how stubborn or crazy or pathetic i seem.

i was with her since pretty much freshman year. i'm gonna be a senior. same major, same small campus, i'm going to see her every fucking day.  i can't go through this pain anymore.

every fucking night for the past 3 months i think about her having sex with this guy she's been on a couple dates with.  every fucking night i can't sleep because that's all i think about.  I can't go through another month like that and i certainly can't go through my senior year like that.  two of the best years of my life seem like a lie now, and now its been the worst 3 months of my life and i honestly have no idea how i've made it this far.

everything just seems like a lie and i can't live a lie anymore.

All my life i've put everyone before me.  my entire relationship i put her above myself, my family, my friends, everyone and everything.  Maybe its about time I do something for myself you know? Stop my own pain and stop worrying about what everyone else will feel or if they will even feel everything.   And i fucking hope she never comes to my grave and says i love you because those simple three words would have made me stay."	1

I need someoneNot in a great place rn	1
I need helpI have a gun in my bedroom and I keep thinking of using it. I don’t think I ever would, but then why does it keep showing up into my thoughts? I have PTSD from 13 years of sexual abuse from my dad. I have anxiety and OCD. I had two panic attacks this evening and no friend would pick up the phone. I texted a new friend who is my coworker and now I regret it and think work will be awkward tomorrow. I have a new job I like but I’m worried I’m not learning fast enough. My coworker says I’m doing fine but I don’t believe him. I feel stupid for texting him in the first place even though he said he has anxiety and if I ever want to talk I can text him. I shouldn’t have. I can’t keep friends. My best friend she just used me as an ATM and for favors. I stopped it today and ended the friendship. I just feel lost. Depressed. Hungry but too tired to eat. I look at my puppy and cry because I don’t want to leave her if I hurt myself. I scratch my hands instead every time i panic and now I have scars. My hands are ugly. I have a significant other. He’s at work so I feel like I have nobody right now to turn to. My family forgot my birthday last week; they went to a casino the night of my scheduled dinner and didn’t invite me. A week later my significant others family scheduled a dinner for my birthday and I showed up to a table of 8 and nobody was there, they forgot. I just feel stupid and alone. Every time I have a panic attack I want To dial the suicide hotline but I don’t. I don’t know anymore. I took my anxiety medicine just now. About to eat. Hoping the thoughts go away. Never sure of where this path leads and at what point I need to call the hotline, or keep telling myself to just breathe. I never can calm my self down. Other people help but I have nobody. 	1
i am literally never good enough for my parents, my friends, anyone and everyone. i am starving myself slowly to death. my stomach is so flat	2
"I don't know anymoreI'm just find myself again sitting on the couch,drinking vodka and crying like a little kid,and btw I'm a 25 y/o male and just crying and drinking until I pass out,I dont know how much I have left,who know how much I can take this.I just can't understand where everything started to collapse.I dropped out of 2 universities,first try was business school,without any good reason I stopped going in my second year.After,I got into computer science where I dropped out after 2.5 years,at this point my gf at that time broke up with me because I didn't have any sense of direction in life.

Fast forward a couple months back,I felt into the pit,feeling lower then ever so my coping mechanism was to drink.Slowly but surely I stopped carrying about anything,quitting my job,and because I had so much free time now I began to drink even more,and it ended sooooo bad.....my last gf couldn't reach me by phone,which was unusual, so she had to leave early from work cuz she had a feeling so she came to my apartment and founded me passed on the floor,she called the ambulance,but I was already in a coma.I woke up in the hospital some days later.After a week from being externated from the hospital my dear,dear gf broke up with me,who could blame her after I did to her,I'm just a piece of shit.And now I'm here,no friends,no family,no gf,almost broke.What should a person like me do?maybe pieces of shit like me shouldn't be alive.

Maybe I have bored you,or you found this depressing but thanks if you took the time to read this and I wish you a good day."	1
"Hotline called cops on me :/So around 1 week ago I contacted the hotline saying I had a plan to kill my self tomorrow and how I was going to do it, after talking with her for 2 hours without my notice she called the police on me, This gave everyone in my house a shock especially when the police said they where investigating a suicide.

Eventually this leads to me being evaluated at a hospital which I lie to them about basically every question they ask me, I constantly denied that it was me who said they where suicidal even though they had some sort of solid proof.

So after lieing through an evaluation I'm discharged, Easy as right? Well thing is is I'm still suicidal and looking at a bunch of pills that I just want to fucking chug right now, Pretty stuck and it's 6 am dk what to do.

I also don't trust the hotline right now as they might pull the same shit on me so here I am."	1

"Relationship activities? So recently I have been working on self improvement, and trying to to be the best version of myself. I wasn't it the shape that I wanted to be in, and found myself becoming not focused and lazy. I have spent time on that, and recently developing better workout routines, and study habits. Skip to yesterday, I am over with a friends house and I have been texting with this girl I have had a crush on for a while. I decide that it is the time, and my boy (who also has a gf) has been hyping me up. For the longest time I wanted to ask her out but assumed she would reject me. I thought this could be a perfect time for me to just shoot my shot, and try to improve from this situation. Anyway, I asked her and she freaked out and got really embarrased. She said she would love to, and we have been texting a ton since. She said that she had a crush on me too, and I was so glad it worked out. I have been in relationships before, but niether really count as they were just 2 flings. I'm familiar with the relationship drama in our class and know that she broke up with another guy a few months ago. That wasn't really a relationship either, as the person who asked her never did much, and didn't treat her with much respect. I really know how great a person she is and I have been so happy recently! I really want to have fun with her, and know that I will not just leave this as a fling. I have been thinking a lot about what things we should do together, and since there is a pandemic right now I know it will be difficult. Anyone who has been a relationship with someone (especially in COVID), it would be very much appreciated if you let me know some fun activities you have engaged in with your signifacant other!

​

TL; DR: I asked a girl who I was into if she wanted to be together, and she said yeah. Now, I'm wondering what sort of activities to do together in a COVID era."	2

My parents are very religious (Hindu) and they follow a superstition that we're not allowed to cut our nails after the sun goes down.

Why do i feel hopeless???its been a few week since i broke up with my girlfriend cause we dont talk to each other that much anymore and it feels like it my fault and i know she told me its not my fault but why does it feel like it is and everyday i think about pretending its was okay and it wasnt going to last but we were together for 4 years since 8th grade and our relationship was strong we would talk about after high school how we would move to a country side and stuff like that but then this Quarantine happened we lost contact with each other she just lost interest with me then one day she messaged me that our relationship wont work i actually was heartbroken and ever since that i actually had thoughts about suicide but i couldnt get through with it cause i was afraid that i would hurt my grandparents so i kept to myself pretended that nothing was wrong i would cry myself to sleep when im alone in my room thinking that i didnt do anything right and i did everything wrong with my relationship and i feel hopeless everyday....	1

Am I truly suicidalI would say I am usually a pretty happy person but suicide and death seem to be in the very back of my mind. I usually don't notice it but there are times where I've had a bad experience and I automatically start thinking about killing myself. Sometimes I imagine different scenarios in my head and a lot of the time they get really dark or bad and I kill myself. These thoughts don't appear too often though and like I said I am usually happy. Am I actually suicidal?	1

"Best Friend Doesn’t Get The Seriousness...this might be a bit of a rant, I’m not even really sure where to start. I have severe depression, anxiety/panic disorder and I hear voices sometimes. I’m under a psychiatrist however due to COVID I haven’t seen anyone face to face now for a long time &amp; my appointments are 3 months apart. 
My best friend has known since we met that I suffer with really bad mental health problems, he knows I have self harmed in the past and knows that I’ve really been struggling lately. 
He’s been away for just over a week I believe, so we’ve not spoke as much or seen each other however I have told him every day of my increasing issues, low mood and wanting to not be here anymore. 
Last night I finally said that I may ring for help today, he offered to ring me and I politely said no, explaining that I’ll just cry and work myself up more. After venting some more then over text message I got “just ring tomorrow then” 
I just told you I couldn’t do this anymore, I’ve spoke about not wanting to be here for over two weeks now, and as my best friend that’s all you say? I feel like I shouldn’t be angry because I shouldn’t expect so much, but I recently helped him through a very tough patch, and now it just seems like when I need help no one is there. 
I don’t know what I’m going to do, I’ve told him I won’t bother him with my issues anymore.

"I dont know how to get helpIve been struggling really hard recently. Im missing half the school days becaude i dont want to get up, and when i am at school all i can think about it how much better it would be if I was asleep or dead, or how much the people around wouldnt care if I wasnt there anymore. I tried last on dec 17 and it didnt work my parents never found out, i took the day after off and on the 19th  i went to school. 

Doing anything productive makes me feel like dying. Its like my head is constantly just telling me to put myself out of my misery. I dont want to be here anymore, and at this point i dont know if I mean the town, the school, the state or even the world. I want to be somewhere else, but I dont want to die. Its starting to feel like the last place i can turn to. Its so exhausting hiding it and doing the things that are constantly making me feel like i should be dead. 

I dont know how to get help. I'm not close with my parents. They dont understand how serious my issues are, when I was first diagnosed with anxiety i was sent to one therapy session, and then when the next one was scheduled, they never took me. Last march i mentioned my anxiety again and my dads response to help was ""just talk to people"" so i dont see them as an option. When I was around 8 or 9 my older sister tried to kill herself, and thats when they took her to therapy, not after she asked and asked. 

Last week my school faced the reality of an old classmate comitting suicide, there wasnt much talk about it, a few Snapchat stories, no assembly or offers to help any students who may have been greiving, or even any help to prevent other students from trying. I didnt know this kid, but it was an eye opener seeing the path i was setting up for myself. The scary thing is that it didnt push me farther, it made me want to hurry up the process and get it over with, like the lack of offers to change was just a clear path to escape. Like even if I got caught, i wouldnt be talked to about it. 

I'm so scared of confrontation, i hate serious situations, i dont know how to get out. I dont want to be here anymore and i don't know what to do except jump the gun and swallow the pills. 

Sometimes im okay. Sometimes, like now, its really hard to resist. Other times ive got 3 pill bottles in front of me and the only thing stopping me is procrastination. Im okay for tonight, im going to sleep, the only thing ive taken is melotonin so I can sleep, but its just getting harder and harder to keep myself alive. Please help me find some way out of this. 

Sorry for the long read. Again, im okay for tonight, but i cant say how well ill be any time in the future."	1

"My mom broke isolation and now I can’t sleep Our family is at small risk of having corona so we’re in isolation and aren’t allowed to walk outside or interact with anybody.

Yesterday I wasn’t allowed to walk down and buy a single item for dinner to make it taste well, which really ruined dinner for me, it was really important that I didn’t go outside for 3 minutes and break isolation, even though it was evening and the only person I’d likely interact with was the person behind the counter.

I didn’t sleep well today and can’t concentrate on reading my book without falling asleep so I decided to take a nap in her bedroom (there are 2 beds, and also I couldn’t sleep in my own room  due to adjacent noise). Just as I’m about to fall asleep for the 7th time, the front door opens up and we’ve got a guest! My mom and the guest starts “speaking” (shouting) to each other in Brazilian.

Hot take on Reddit: Not all conservatives are racist, transphobic idiots and most of them want to quit hate speech just as much as you do. I'm not into politics that much, but I'm tired of seeing some degenerate on Reddit and in the comments it's just people bashing the right wing for no reason. Why are we honing in on politics here? Why don't we unite on hating this person's views instead of dividing ourselves over our own? Why can't we agree that some things should be universally hated, regardless of political affiliation?	2

I'll have only earned the sympathy of the few redditors who will read this and forget about this tomorrow. Nobody cares.

I'm quite suprised I've gone this long. How have I not realized it? What have I been telling myself? How did I fool myself for so long. I must have ignored it.

Im useless in this world. Utterly fucking useless, my god. By god. I'm a university dropout and an unsociable loser. Those are the only traits I can own up to. I actually feel bad for writing this distributing my shitty attitude amongst you.

I've no clue why I feel this way. I've no clue why I feel anything. I'll doubt I'll find and answer before I pull the trigger of this shotgun lmao. Holy shit I'm sad.

If somebody cared about me would I feel different? Yeah probably. I probably wouldn't​ kill myself so they wouldn't feel bad. But damn I don't even have that. I've no safety net here. I'm free to live and I'm free to die, and looks like I've made my choice. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of disappointing people I meet. I'm tired of giving a fuck about what people think about me. It's so exhausting. I'm so fucking sick of it. I hate it, I hate myself. I hate that I can't change myself. I've tried. I've tried so hard. If I could change myself, I would have fucking killed myself. But here I am.

Yeah if you're content with where you are and who you are, color me fucking jealous. I'd love to feel what's that's like. I'd love to be satisfied with myself and my accomplishmens. Please savor that. Savor the fact you aren't a hopeless piece of shit like me, writing out to a suicide subreddit in the final moments of your life. I'm getting tired if even writing this, the final cathartic moment I'll experience. 

I hope there's an aftelife or something, I hope it isn't just darkness. But I can rest assured that whatever I'm subjected to after I extinguish my consciousness here, that I'll suffer less that what I am now. Later!"	1
"I've become comfortable with the feeling of the inevitable. Now I'm concerned.I haven't planned on posting anything on this, and this isn't something that I would normally do at all. This is all going to sound very rough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was about 12 I had thoughts about suicide, I was severely depressed and it became the norm for me to think about it daily - although I never planned on acting on it, then. Through the years my periods of depression came and went, sometimes for a month and once or twice for a full year (2012, 2016). Do to the fact I would think about this so often, it had normalised it in my head - or only now do I realised I normalised it. The past few months have been particularly bad for me. I've lost my job that I loved, have had to move out from my flat back to my parents and been diagnosed with ADHD. And I'm finding it really fucking difficult to find a job, or at least one that is as creatively fulfilling (I'm a designer). I've been processing a lot of things recently - and have been thinking about it a lot - not with any intention. It's now affecting me in my day-to-day - I find it really hard to find motivation because at the back of my head I feel like thats where it could end up, its inevitable, its been staring at me running through my mind for all these years and I just never acknowledged it so.   


Ontop of that, something changed last night. I had been thinking about it alot before I go sleep, I cant seem to help it it just happens. I have always processed it alot, but not with any intention. Last night when I was lying in bed, it was like a wave or something and I dont know what happened but all of a sudden I became completely comfortable with it. Like, 100%.   


I don't plan on acting on it, but I'm finding it really hard to shift this 'inevitability' from front of mind. And **that** scares me.   


Does any one else get this, lifetime bombardment of thoughts and fear of in the inevitable? Is this fucking normal?   


Sorry if this is all muddled up and disjointed - I'm literally throwing it all down as it comes to my head. Peace"	1

"Hi, I think I'm suicidal. More details inside, just need to vent and tell someone. Why not strangers on the internet? Hi. I'm an eighteen year old male, and I think I'm suicidal. 

I've had the urge to kill myself for a couple years now. It's just that recently the idea pops up in my head more often. 

I feel like my whole life I've been abandoned, my parents, friends, and others have left me in the dust for something better. I've had girls tell me they love me, think I'm perfect, and want to be with me. But they'll date someone else while leading me on. It's come to the point that I'm desensitized to things like that. I don't think I can love someone without worrying it's going to end abruptly. 

It's just that sometimes I'll think 'hmm, oblivion, no emotions, no pain, peace.' And I'll contemplate just killing myself. I mean, once I'm dead I won't have to worry about anything. I'll be free. Nothing to cause me pain. 

So, yeah, I guess you could call me suicidal. I see no happy future for me, and all my happy memories have something bad attached.

"Repost from today's post (mistake caused trouble)Note: I reposted this so you guys can give me advice how to deal in this kind of situation. What I can expect from the police and what I can do to defend myself in case she sues me. 

From here on is my previous post, after this comes the edit.

""We have met in a game only about a week ago and I already know a lot about you. You are depressed and suicidal, the things you went through must be unbearable. We have been talking on snapchat and you were telling me things that really made me sad. I sometimes bug you and call you to make sure you are alright and spam you but that's only because I care. Yesterday at night I wrote to you for the last time as I didn't get any response anymore after calling and messaging several times. Today I really got anxious and took action. I live in another country but I still took measures and called the institutions you said you were going to. I even called your school and the police. Sadly they wouldn't tell me if you were alright or not because of security reasons. I kept calling your school and they told me if I called one more time I would get reported. I called the police and they told me they'd send a unit to your school to make sure you were ok. About an hour/1,5  ago I saw your snapchat location showed you were online at that moment. I still try to reach for you. And I am very sorry if I vexed you and caused you trouble. The police told me they would contact your parents, and I know your father is an asshole and tells you to kill yourself, so I hope he didn't flip out or anything. I wanted to come visit you in London but you refused and didn't feeI comfortable with it which is understandable, I asked for your phone number you didn't give it for the same reason. But thank god I know your first name and I knew which school you are going to, I dug and found your surname as well, and gave it to the police. I  just hope everything is alright and may god be with you. Don't leave me please, I am dying from inside...""

Edit: she screenrecorded our snapchat conversation and blocked me. My guess is that she is going to report me to the cops, my selfie was there too. Did I bring myself in danger? Will this have a bad end for me?

"I simply cannot restartHello complete fucking strangers. I usually am on the other end of these things begging strangers to change theit habits meditate, read some books, stop thinking negatively, pick up an instrument, exercise, ect ect... Today is different though, I have found a problem for which there is no contingency. 

I have been depressed for years, since I was 10 years old. I was a isolated angry child. In high school I was an akward pariah with a bad reputation. Through out most of my childhood I have been bullied or been involved in horrible one sided relationships. Toward the end of junior year things started to turn around for me. I was making real friendships, and I had a social life.

About a year ago my most recent bought of anxiety and depression started. My main group of friends blew up when an argument between me and a friend horribly escalated. Nobody really talks anymore and it made me look pretty terrible to say the least. Soon after that I noticed one of my oldest friends was sociopathic. He lied to me on multiple occasions, wether it be telling me the girl I was talking to was a lesbian or when he snitched another friend out ruining his life to keep himself out of trouble. When I confided in him he would use it as ammunition in later arguments. ""This is why everyone hates you"", he knew how paranoid I was about that type of shit. One day he was on Xanax driving stuffing his face with McDonald's. I pleaded with him to pay attention but they were met with insults. He almost wreaked, and after that I kicked him out of my life. He than told everyone I was unstable, and since I stayed bitter while he cleaned up his act. He stopped pissing everyone off and dug in his heels while I tried to convince a few other something was wrong. ""That's just how he is, he's just a dick sometimes"", needless to say I lost to his manipulation. I can see on Instagram and snapchat how much fun they have without me. I don't really have my friends from high school between these two incidents my reputation has been severely damaged. Now at work I am getting a reputation for being a weirdo. It's getting harder and harder to communicate with others, and I can hear the part-timers in particular openly talking shit. 

My brother and I were discussing how bad things have gotten. He tells me my only option is to restart find completely new friends and a new job. It's that or be ignored by everyone who I thought was my friend and be stuck in a workplace that's beginning to feel a lot like high school. At 21 years old after watching everything blow up in my face I just don't think I can do it"	1

I really don't want to live and to be honest, there really isn't anything stopping me from doing it...I don't think I'm someone worth missing....I don't feel attached to anything...I just feel empty.

"I'm not depressed because of videogames Mom and Dad I'm depressed because you take away all my electronics and then act like the victims when I actively express myself and give you solutions other than isolating me from my friends and family.

Jk I'm not an adult so my opinion is irrelevant and I'm supposed to respect you in order to earn social interactions with people who actually listen to me and what I have to say

I totally agree with literally cutting me off from the internet to do 30 minutes of chores and then sit around doing nothing.

What's that? All I do is sit on my ass all day? Wonder who's genius idea that was. 

If you have a problem with me why did you have me in the first place? You can't blame me for being the way I am if all you do is use me to do things you can easily do on your own. Is it really that hard to wash your ONE plate after eating a sandwich? Are you and Dad REQUIRED BY LAW to leave the entire sink full of dishes in the 8 hours of sleep that I get? 

But yeah sure; scold me and ban me. That'll definitely  ""improve my attitude"". Sound logic. 

I literally get not even 2 full months of time off from school and I don't even get to spend 3 weeks actually relaxing and blowing off some steam.

Very vivid ideationI'm a bipolar male 24 in a few weeks. Currently going through vivid images of commiting suicide in different ways, like as vivid as real life.

Is assisted suicide an option at this pointIs it possible, for me, a 15 year old undiagnosed jersey kid to apply for the Death with Dignity in the state of New Jersey?

I'm too scared to do it on my own, and I understand all the consequences of suicide, but I am confident that I wish to, and have been for years.	1
I need to do it.I thought I was doing well enough to not want to off myself. Mostly because I’ve been in such a depressive episode I hadn’t showered for a week, and barley ate anything so I didn’t have the energy to really think about killing myself. I kept wondering why I was so anxious today, until I realized all of these overwhelming emotions have caught up with me, and I so desperately wish to be dead. There’s nothing more I want than to be dead, I don’t want to wake up but I feel so fucking selfish to even think like that when other people are fighting for their lives. Be killing myself would make me feel so guilty for all the pain I’ve caused other people, but I want to be gone for good.	1

"I'm going to do it. I know I have to now.I have attempted suicide 3 years ago, senior year of high school, but wound up confessing what I had done to my parents.  I was hospitalized, put on meds, and was somewhat under control for the past 2 years of college other than a few months of self harm. 

This semester has been a roller coaster.  I broke up with my boyfriend of two years, and was feelin good about it for a while.  But I don't know, something snapped and I found myself going through phases of being so happy I felt unstoppable, to being so weary and lethargic that I couldn't even get out of bed or talk to people.  I would hide in my room all day because the thought of speaking with people genuinely made me feel terrified.  I would go days without eating simply out of laziness.  I wound up doing horribly in my grades-  I got a D in one class and a C in another and I'm taking this as reassurance from the universe that it is time for me to die.  I'm going to wait until after the holidays for my family's sake..but I really cannot go on knowing I've disappointed my family in this way.  I don't deserve to live, I've ruined myself.  "	1

"I've decided to do itAfter many years of dealing with depression and anxiety, I've decided it's finally time. I've had two previous attempts, both of which I fucked up, one of which landed me in hospital. This time I've found a quick and easy way to do it that has a very high success rate.

This has been a long time coming. I've planned everything out now and have decided it is what I want to do, this is not a spur of the moment thing. I've made sure that no debt will be left to my family and I'm in the process of writing a general suicide note, a goodbye note for each of my friends and family members, and selecting somebody I trust to pass my passwords etc. to when I do it.  


I'm not going to do it before Christmas simply for the fact that it would be unfair for my friends and family to have this festive time of the year ruined by my selfish decision. I've not decided the date but it'll probably be around February. I also need to gather the materials and decide on a suitable location.  


Does anyone have any advice for other things I should do in preparation? I want to make this as easy as possible for everyone else in my life."	1

I don’t have anything left to live for- the people close to me will be fine. They’ll be better off without me.

I’m a really awful person and I’ve been trying to change but I have reached my breaking point. I don’t know whether this is a note or a cry for help, but I can’t do this anymore. 

I know that there’s a chance that somebody I know in person will read this, and all I ask is that you let me have peace with this decision. Maybe in another lifetime things may have been different, but the fact is that I can’t change a thing. I’m going crazy stuck inside my own head, and I don’t ever see an end to it.

i have tried kill myself many times, most of these times were because of bullying, and maybe because the bullies were right i am worthless.

i could go on about how pathetic my existence is, but it is to much to write in one post.

"Everything has fallen apartI just can’t do this anymore, my mental state has been getting constantly worse to the point where I’m almost constantly thinking about ending my own life, worst part is because my friends knew about it but I can’t ask for help directly they cut contact for a month leaving me to suffer.

Today when I was already feeling more suicidal than normal my friend was getting into it but when I explained why I can’t make myself ask for help he blocked me :)

He was one of my few friends, and since this is what happened last time, the others probably hate me too, they’d be better off without me anyway. I had promised myself that I wouldn’t live to 20 and with my birthday coming up next month it seems that everything is coming together, any suggestions for writing a suicide note before I go?"	1

Productivity advice needed. Hello people of reddit. I'm 18 and going to college. It is my first year on college and I am some what enjoying it. The only downside right now is that I almost no physical classes have and almost only online. The problem with that is that it is almost impossible to follow them for me. I sometimes have class at 8 in the morning and wake up at 7 but then just don't join the call. I also don't do anything else except for daydreaming.

I just ripped off my acrylic nails 💔 So much regret	2
"Lost my job, the closest thing I've had to a girlfriend and my last shred of confidence...For the last few months I've been out of work on disability for depression which I've struggled with for the past 15 years (I spent a year and a half of high school in an outpatient program at a hospital, residential treatment centers, laundry lists of psychotropics...).  Last Thursday I had another meeting with my psychiatrist to finish the paperwork to extend my disability (already a month late) with a little assignment she had given me.  Because she had taken a month to complete the paperwork, my office sent a letter stating that if the disability claim wasn't worked out or if I didn't return to work by last Friday, I would be terminated.  So, when I show this letter to my doc, she tells me I should just go back to work and that she wouldn't sign anything else affirming my inability to function on the job.  

I went straight from the doc to a female friend's house who had just moved to the city a week before.  I had fallen in love with her in high school but then she started dating my best friend.  I held my tongue as long as I could but finally just had to tell her how I felt, making all of my friends think I was trying stab her boyfriend in the back.  So I was shunned by the bunch of them for a good year or so until the bf left the country.  However, throughout all of this I kept in touch with  the girl with whom I exchanged emails fairly regularly.  This was about seven years ago.  

We go get a bite to eat and when we get back to her place she's all over me, the most affection I've ever been fortunate to receive.  We keep out pants on, but that's about it.  I go home feeling on top of the world.  She has some obligations the next day, so I spend the time deep cleaning my apt, finally doing something productive.  The following day, we spend the whole day together, capped off with even heavier petting and repetitive proclamations of love from both of us (her first...).  

The next day, last Sunday, we were to see a concept together that we'd both been excited about for weeks and which she couldn't stop talking about.  About an hr before I went to pick her up, she sends a text saying she got strep throat and couldn't speak... I was a little suspicious, given the hours we spent in each others mouths the night before, but whatever, just wanted to do what I could to help her feel better.  No response, no response, no response.... must just be sleeping it off.

Finally, Monday night at around 11pm, after I'd flown to my parents' for the holidays, I get a text saying ""I want to be blunt, I have no romantic feelings for you.""  It was like I got the wind knocked out of me before I'd even taken my first breath...  She defriended me on face book, and hasn't responded to anything since.  What hurts/scares me the most is that this just makes me doubt even more my ability to understand people which has always been excruciatingly difficult.  

I don't have a job, I don't have any friends I can talk to in my city, have an incredible difficulty speaking to those elsewhere, and those that I'm closest to are in the process of kicking heroin...   Every girl/woman I've ever been interested in has either completely blown me off or led me on for months/years (multiple ""I love yous,"" always conditional.  Either just over a breakup and ""need some time"" or ""just not in *that* way).  And every time just hurts more...

It's been 15 years of people saying it will get better, and it will momentarily, but every time I fall, I fall farther and harder.  And after going through the psychology/psychiatry circuit for so long I've haven't heard anything new in a long fucking time...  Not to mention that the therapist I bonded most with and helped shape my view of the world, who I saw for 10 years, had a breakdown himself and no one (knew his friends/family by the end) has heard from in a few years.  He was last seen being released from the psych ward.  And the psychiatrist I bonded most with (4 years) had a breakdown too and stopped practicing.  

I've become more and more closed off from new therapists, always downplaying suicidal thoughts because I don't want to committed, and if I really do want to die I don't want them stopping me.  Even when I do open up I just get the same things I've heard for fucking years...  

The thought of hurting my family which has been so supportive my whole life is the only thing that has prevented me, but even that is meaning less to me as the days go by...

I don't really know why I'm posting here... 

tl;dr: 15 years of depression, forever alone, lost job, teased with a relationship, shunned, no local friends, out-of-town friends have their own issues namely heroin....

A user by the name ""Ryfflex"" contacted me. We talked, for a couple of months off and on before my life had gotten too busy and I hadn't had time to check up or get back to you.

I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account (you had mentioned it was a throw away) but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still 'okay'.

I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others, now I want to check up on you.

Hopefully you have made another account, and hopefully you are able to see this. I just want you to know that I am still here to talk to.

Let me know how you are buddy. Hope to hear from you again soon."	1

Talking stage So is it considered the talking stage if they live in a different state or like the other side of the country? Cuz I’m trying to figure out if I’m in the talking stage with like 3 girls, but I’m wondering does it even count if I’m probably never going to see them. Also I’m not a hoe, I used to be the typical shy redditor then I said fuck it and decided to be more bold and here I am now.	2

"Suicide, and it's cowardice. Or is it?Much like the rest of the world, I live with the thoughts of suicide, day in and out. I hear on a regular basis (local folk, not on the internet), that suicide is a coward's method, that it is 'taking the easy way out' instead of solving the problem.

Still, I'd rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive, and quite frankly, creepy behaviour that I can't seem to be rid of.

I've driven all my friends away, save the select few I've known for years. I've distanced myself from family, and I live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that I can't let go of until I'm forgiven by whom I'd hurt. 

Suicide, and for that matter, any death, is not 'the easy way out', because it's enduring one final pain to make the rest stop. Those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness, we embrace it. While it brings sorrow to our families, they get over it, just like the rest of the problems they face.

We're remembered for the positives, not for the negatives. And, I think that counts for something. It's not cowardice that drives is to that point. It's one final breath of courage.

Much like many other members of my family, I'm sure that one day I will join the great darkness. Fit now though, I have my obsession to keep me alive, and people I must care for."	1

There's a limit to everythingI've been unemployed for months, not eligible for government assistance, and working my ass off to find a job. I put in at least 40 hours a week searching for work and nearly half of that is pounding the pavement. I've run out of money and have no idea how I'm paying my bills after this month. I was graciously gifted a few hundred bucks to stock up on groceries, household items, and to pay a bill. I was only able to do a little grocery shopping before it was stolen from me. I have 15 bucks in my PayPal account and no idea what I'm going to do if I don't get a job in the next couple of days. Tonight is the first time I've cried about my problems because I really don't know if I want to wake up tomorrow (if I can even sleep at all). I'm a fairly positive person, but there's a limit to the amount of shit someone can take before it's too much. I'm pretty sure I'm at my limit. Everything seems so chaotic and all I want to do is cease to exist. I'm tired.	1

"The Education System I would like to start by saying that this isn't meant to offend anyone, but this needs to be addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

The education system is so majorly fucked up. And frankly, I'm done dealing with it. I'm sick of being part of a system that doesn't care about me, or my mental health. I try to explain to the adults in my life that I'm stressed out, and that I have a life outside of school work, they hit me with the ""WeLl WhEn I wAs A tEeNaGeR"". We get it, you were a perfect teenager and everyone loved you. But education has changed in the 30-40 years you've been out of school. It's much more stressful, and we get a lot more work than you did. So stop trying to tell me that I'm lazy, or not normal, or stupid, because you know nothing about what we're talking about."	2
I give up on life Feeling worthless tbh. I just recently accepted that I can’t move forward with my life. With all of the advice or support that you guys give me, nothing’s changed. I’m just the same old same old. Nothing will ever change. That’s just fact for me. I honestly feel like I’m an abomination. I hate myself and my body. Everyone always calls me skinny, I feel embarrassed when I’m made fun of for my body. I also feel ugly, some people have gave me gestures of disgust when they see me, one kid even called me ugly. I’m going to just keep playing video games and watch YouTube. I’m going to abandon my dreams and just find a new job or career. Here’s to being worthless. Bye guys have a good day.	2

She'll get to the point where she's in tears and HAVE to go to the hospital because she's tired of being in pain, but they think it's all in her head.

Because of all this, she feels hopeless. This is her message.

"I really fucking hate my class (9th grade btw)
I’ve never really liked them that much but I could hang out with them and all but now it’s just too much. The amount of casual racism and other shitty stuff is being said, not only to me (I don’t really care that much cause I don’t care about them tbh. I’m biracial btw so apparently that makes me black or something according to them) but to anyone that isn’t native to the country. “Immigrant” and the N word and all sorts of other racial slurs are being said regularly and it’s starting to piss me off. I’m a non confrontational person so I just keep quiet but god I’m dying inside whenever the hell they open their mouths.

They have to make mean comments and make fun of people’s appearances all the time. In real life and even just watching someone in a movie or a documentary. Stop and be respectful for gods sake. 

They disrespect teachers, don’t respect their privacy (searching through my teachers google search history on his personal PC while he wasn’t around) make fun of muslim teachers for their religion and of course racial slurs (never to their face of course cause they don’t wanna get in trouble) 

They disrupt the class all the time. 2 girls laugh every 30 seconds almost and it’s distracting and annoying, one boy has the mentality of a 7 year old. 

They gotta make fun of accents, make fun of movements, make fun of clothing, make fun of what music people listen to, make fun of people’s jobs, make fun of people’s education, make fun of what phone you have and all sorts of other bullshit that literally does not fucking matter but they take time out of their day to make fun of the smallest things and it’s so stupid, mean and pointless that it actually makes me angry to the point of me writing this to let out my anger (cause like I said before I never speak my mind) they even made fun of people with conditions like Down syndrome because “they look funny” keep in mind these people are 14-16 years old and it’s unbelievable how fucking immature they are at that age."	2

My mum died six months ago and I just feel so guilty because she was in hospital for 4 weeks before she died and I didn't visit her once and I don't think I can handle the rest of my life without her. It's stupid I know but I just can't help thinking that if I'd    visited her and talked to her she might still be alive. Like I know logically that me telling her I love her wouldn't have made her get better but idk.

I just really want to die, I'm so tired and it's just not worth it. 

I'm sorry this isn't very coherent but it's 2:30am and tl;dr I want to fucking die and I'm just a worthless selfish piece of shit "	1
"My reason to live left me. I don't want to go on, I don't know if I can.My life has been miserable for as long as I can remember. A broken home, poor family, drunken stepfather, loving but weak willed mother, and 2 siblings that I love but was too angry to be a good big brother for.


All the way up until I left for college, I was filled with sadness, rage and hate, hate for myself. I cut myself a lot in high school, because I hate who I am and hurting myself felt right. The scars are still very visible even today. 


All of those feelings finally faded after I met her. She wasn't the first person I loved, but she was the first one who TRULY loved me back, and was really good to me. Just a few weeks after we started dating we cried in each other's arms because we were so happy together, so happy to find someone good in this world.


She is my world, she's the only thing in my life that made me want to live, and for the past 4 years I have lived, just so I could be with the one person who helped me to finally be happy. She's everything to me, and I know in my heart there's no one else out there who could be as wonderful as her.


Today, Nov 5, would have been our 4 year anniversary. Wednesday of last week, on the 1st, she left me while I was at work. I never saw it coming, but I came home to find the door unlocked, all of her things gone, and a note saying goodbye. She never talked to me about any problems in our relationship, if she had I would have done anything to make it right, anything to make her as happy as possible, but I didn't know. We never fought, never argued, just love, so much damned love that I thought I was in a dream.


Her note said she resented me for my procrastination, and that I didn't share enough of her interests. The things she noted I would have gladly went out to do with her, if she'd only talked with me things could have been even better for us both. I loved going on dates with her, money has just been tight the past few months after we moved, and she didn't give us a chance to get back on our feet to do nice things again.


I gathered from her note that she has gone back to her ex, the one person that has a truck, the one person who I've not gotten a response from. I trusted her to talk to him online because it was a group chat with all of their friends in it. I trusted her to go on a week vacation with all of those friends, including him, because I thought she truly loved me all these years and would never betray that trust. 


When she came back, she acted a little different. At first I thought she was adjusting to coming back home. I finally asked her what was wrong but she said everything was fine. Not wanting to push I thought I'd let her talk to me when she was ready. Now she's gone and I've heard nothing from her since.


I haven't eaten since she left, I can't sleep well if even at all, I had panic attacks in my sleep a couple of nights ago. I'm back in the darkness that I thought I'd escaped years ago. I hate myself for losing the one person who was good to me. I hate myself for not being what she wanted. I want to die so I don't have to feel this pain anymore, so I don't have to be without her. She took her guns so I would have to do it painfully with a knife. It would hurt, but I don't even care about that, I deserve the pain because of this self hatred that I can't suppress.


There's only one thing that holds me back. My little brother died at age 17 this year in May. Losing him hurt us all, most of all my mother. I love her, she's a loving mother and I don't want to put her through losing both sons in the same year. However, at the same time I feel like after all these years of pain I deserve to be selfish just one final time. I feel like everyone should understand that I deserve to end my pain and misery. I've been so good to my lovers and they always hurt me deeply, this one being the worst pain I've ever felt, because I truly felt in my heart that she was the one.


Would my mother, my family understand this? Could they forgive me for wanting to be free of the pain? I don't want them to feel guilty, like there was anything they could do. It's just me, there's something wrong inside of me, and I can't cope with it anymore. My love was the one person who took the pain away, without her I can't take it. It's all come back in a rush of agony and hurt. I'm only 24, and imagining dealing with this misery until I die of natural causes is too much, I can't bear the thought of it. I just hope that telling people who might understand these things, that I can't tell my family, might help.


I don't want my family to hurt, but I deserve to be free of the pain in my heart at long last."	1

I am just so angry at this world. I have no one in the real world to turn to. This virtual life is like another reality. When I shut this phone, I have to face the fact that I am me, a worthless human being. I’m so tired of being tired. I’m thankful for the people on here who have reached out on the way. But, it’s nothing like being with someone in real life who wants to be near you. It’s like I don’t exist to anyone but my family.	1

Is friendship just,, not for me? Couple months ago, my best friend left me. I don't have many friends so she was quite important to me and so her leaving was painful. Because she was such a large part of my life, now I don't know what to do with myself. However, this has got me thinking. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. It's happened twice before, in almost the exact way. I get to know someone, we get extremely close and mean a lot to each other, then out of nowhere everything starts to go downhill and they lose interest in me or something and leave. Idk what it is specifically cause they never tell me. This is the 3rd time it's happened in a row, so I'm starting to see a pattern here that leads me to believe I'm not cut out for relationships with other people. Probably my fault, maybe I'm too emotionally immature or I'm far too boring once you get to know me? No idea. So I guess at least for now, I need to just be by myself until I know how to keep friends.	2

"Questions about SuicideSo I've been considering suicide, I have a history of that shit. I'm in a bad depression. I don't know why I'm thinking of suicide. I'm bipolar, so I know this is all bound to end, rather soon, soon being probably in 6 months at least. So it's not that I believe this is a never ending pain thing. But the depression really hurts and I'm scared I'm going to commit suicide. I don't want to actually die, I want to live and enjoy life. I don't want the ones I love to grieve, although I wish they would understand where I'm coming from, understood how bad things are. I go to work and just cry and it's so embarrassing. 

I feel like I can't trust myself. I'm afraid if I get in my car and drive I'm going to drive to where I where I want to commit it. I'm scared I'm going to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping and commit it. I feel like I'm on the brink of doing that. I feel like this is the end and I can't imagine actually living another week or so. I feel like I want to do this and this is my destiny. I'm scared this is going to be one big impulse and I won't be able to take it back.

So I've been telling myself suicide is an active, conscious decision. It won't happen unless I decide to do it. So here are my questions, what if I /decide/ to do it, and go off to do it, how do I stop myself, what am I suppose to do? When people commit suicide, do they have a clear reason in their mind?

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. My pdoc just gave me a new anti depressant so I'm really hoping it works sooner rather than later. I do all they say to treat depression but it's not work. So yes I do exercise and all these different things a therapist would suggest. "	1

I have 10 siblings (one living with us, locks himself in his room) that don’t talk to me though i wish they did, give me advice for what to do or explain how they dealt with my parents. my mom is an alcoholic, at least once a week she’ll get nasty, call me names, says she’ll kill herself because she cant deal with us, hit me, etc. my dad will skip days off work because he cant get out of bed, incredibly down. hes an alcoholic as well, less functional when hes drunk but wouldnt hurt anybody. hes extremely sensitive and if someone looked at him a certain way or didnt reply to him or laugh at his jokes he’ll yell, say we dont love him or leave

an online friend ive had is honestly the only thing keeping me alive, i look forward to talking to them even though its incredibly awkward and starting to go downhill. its all i ever think about, and when theyre feeling down themselves i completely shut down. everything is so much more intense when theyre away or something is wrong over there. i know its not healthy to absolutely depend on someone else. im having a lot of trouble finding new friends and sharing the love to multiple people. im terribly shy and insecure, if i think i did something wrong ill go on an apologizing rampage and bash myself in chat and ruin the atmosphere. and then ill say sorry for that too. ill go away for weeks because i think i deserve it and that they would want me to. come back and apologize because id worried them, feel awful. similar to what my dad does.l

theyve been having a lot of trouble on their half as well, itd be another paragraph to explain it though. weve been exchanging vents but its only tearing us two apart, and we know it. weve gone over it, started over, a million times. if they go i will too

i know i have to look ahead to ever get through it, but right now i dont know if I even see a future at all. and i know there are countless people going through unimaginable situations, feels so selfish to even vent. i believe that if youre your top priority, youll take care of yourself no matter what environment youre in. but if youre not, youre just gonna bully yourself no matter where you go. idk how to move forward, ive tried so many times, i can predict how people try to help, twist it around and make it negative

it feels so pointless, i ask them if they want to talk, they say “i do” when were both aware that it will fall again, we’ll hurt ourselves again, shit will happen over and over.  but i cant leave it, nor can i leave this house. even if i got away its still in my head, im stuck forever unless i go. everyday i go to school itching to go home to hurt myself, unless my friend is happy then i am. so mad at myself feel like ican do anything"	1

"Job slavery increases thoughts of suicideI don’t see a point for working for a living at some dead end job that I won’t enjoy doing for my whole life. My life projection consists of staying at my dads place until he’s passed away then it will probably be a matter of time until I’m homeless unless my sister gets a job. I just feel like a burden at this point amounting for nothing. 

I got in contact with disability employment services to find work just to keep my dad happy. So I’ll just ride it out with this employment crap while my dad is alive then after that just die from starvation out in a secluded area in my town. And I’m surprisingly comforted with this thought that one day this rat race will be over."	1
I feel like I’m gonna explode :O My crush texted me today but I haven’t been able to see him for months. I thought he didn’t like me back (I haven’t talked to him about it since corona interrupted all that), but now I’m starting to question it. I told my friend the other day I thought he didn’t like me and was crying and all that’s shit, so I’ll kinda feel like an idiot texting her about this change. At the same time I haven’t talked to this one friend who also also friends with my crush in a while, so I’m low key tempted to rant to him about it too. However that could backfire really easily. I would just confess to my crush but like I said I haven’t seen him in forever. I feel like I’m gonna combust soon...	2
"I don’t have an interesting titleThis is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I don’t even know how to start this off. I’m just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I’m also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it’d make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasn’t enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. I’m in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don’t even know if I want to do it anymore.

I’m just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I’m back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don’t think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It’s a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

I’m visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I’m staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn’t good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I’ve really fucked it up now. She didn’t even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won’t go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just can’t get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. 

I’m a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. I’m just out here dying and I’m getting closer everyday to just saying “fuck it”. I just don’t know how much more I can take. I’ve been dealing with since this I was 15. I just didn’t know what I was when I was that young. 

I don’t know how far into 2018 I’m going to make it. 2018 might be the last year of my existence. "	1

Tired of feeling ugly, unwanted and unlovedI've always been overweight and felt ugly and somewhat socially awkward so I never had the confidence to approach the girls I was attracted to, in fear of rejection...so I always just settled for the unattractive girls with low self esteem to satisfy my sexual desires. But sex with someone you're not physically attracted to gets boring really quick. And everyday the voice in my head telling me to end it all gets louder because I fear no matter what I do I'll never truly be happy.	1
"My coworker and friend is suicidal. I don't know how to help, but I want to.Hi there.

A coworker of mine has struggled with depression for a long time (I believe at least a decade), but I have known him for only the last year and a half. He recently entered a relationship with a former coworker, and I'm not sure if she knows but I have never met her so it is not my place to let her know his current situation. The only reason I know he is suicidal is that he posted in here two months ago and I recognized his username. 

Because I'm not his girlfriend and we do not interact on a daily basis, I don't know how to show my support without seeming awkward or intrusive. He plays a major role in the restaurant we both work in, but this has clearly had a major impact on his mental health. 

Everyone's mental health is different. What works for one person (i.e., medication, therapy, support) may not work for another. However, I want to know how to connect with this person and let them know that there are resources available to him, be it our human resource department or some other counselling service.

And friend, if you're perusing this subreddit looking for a sign to live a little longer, a presence to reach out to, this is it."	1
"I think I’m going to stop watching hentai Reddit crashed when I was almost finished with this post so if something is covered by that &gt;!spoiler thing!&lt; it might be disturbing

Homeless and hopelessBack in December my mom lost her job. We're homeless and unemployment runs out mid June. (HR hired convicted drug dealers and her employees were going behind her back and lying. It was complete bullshit.) I've been suffering with depression and suicidal tendencies since I was about 9. It's just me and her, and I just don't think I can do it anymore. We're thankfully able to stay with a family friend, but it's extremely stressful. I can't get a job because we're in the middle of nowhere and I wouldn't have transportation. If we both even managed to find a job, it'd be $9 an hour minimum wage...and we can't live off of that. We bot have chronic pain and I don't want her to work herself to death with 2 jobs. Every single day I just feel hopeless and wishing I could kill myself. she's 53 and every single job she's applied to has lead to nothing. She's an incredible worker, and she's had a lot of interviews, but her age is causing her to lose the jobs. I'm scared, because we'll have no income soon and there's nothing good to look forward to. I've been able to make just enough to cover our asses each month through art commissions, but...I'm tired. I don't see the point in fighting anymore. We've lost everything. I'm going to live in poverty forever and I'm bitter that my only 2 friends are able to go to college and have everything stable.	1

"I feel like this is the end.Hi Reddit, I don't know how much longer I have on this world, but goddammit I need someone to talk to. I'll only tell you some basic facts about me, only because you don't need my life story. I'm drunk right now so I'm sorry if I make any typing or grammar mistakes:

First off, as I just mentioned, I'm drunk. This is an issue because I'm underage, in fact I'm not even an adult. It isn't that I'm going out to parties to get drunk, in fact it's the opposite. The people who are supposed to love me the most and protect me are my enablers, my parents, who have drank before and after my birth for as long as I have been able to remember. I'm the last child, the youngest, so I am a victim and a product of dealing with my parents who are at the age of where they don't give a fuck anymore. My dad is a reserved, quiet, nice man. He brings home the bread and that keeps him happy, aside from his booze. My mother is the polar opposite, jobless, a ""stay-at-home"" mom, suffering from a disease that makes her head feel like she's been spun around in a tornado and then let go. She's loud, gets angry easily, and makes my life more miserable than I'd like. She's also one of the most emotional and passionate people I've ever met and I love her. She's lost a son before and that's been one of the reasons I haven't offed myself yet.

Tonight, we had our weekend tradition. Get drunk, play games, listen to music, chill, and talk. During the play games session (I get very upset over games, I got my short temper from my mother) I got angry at my mother for how she was playing the game, she started to yell at me, I threw my cards at her, almost broke my bottle from slamming it, and retreated to my computer. No one has spoken to me since. 

Since they are asleep, I began going through the medicine cabinet and I began looking at medicine in there. Googling the overdose effects and seeing how long it would take to kill me. Nothing I found interested me, most of them would kill me in 70+ hours after tons of pain and suffering, which isn't what I want. Hanging myself seems too awful, every time I think of it I picture the screams of whoever finds me, and I don't want to do that to someone. There's no working guns in my house, so that's out of the option. 

I don't know anymore, I just actively looked for ways to kill myself. If I found something proper, I probably would've done it. What the fuck is wrong with me?"	1
"Im uncertain of what i want. death by dehydrationI've thought about killing myself a few months back when I was pretty fucked up emotionally, I didn't know how i would want to do it and what way would be painless and wouldn't cause as many problems for my family. But now I think im ready and I think I've found my way out. 

Context to this situation is Im a 20 y/o gay male and the only friend I have is my ex boyfriend, he's now found his way into another relationship, im happy for him, but in this sense ive lost my friend because he doesn't want to hurt his partner by just participating in idle chat with me. With everything else happening in my life, losing the one person I talk to sent me to have a mental break and I sat crying in front of my ex after he had told me that he can't talk to me any more, I cried and couldn't even make sense of what i was saying, what pained me the most is that he looked at me as if I was insane. There was just alot of me crying because I had lost my friend (at this point he wasn't someone I though of as my ex partner, he was just my best friend) he drove me home and couldn't help but just sit in silence. As I hopped out of the car I said the main things that i enjoyed about when I saw him but I ended the conversation with ""thank you, I love you like family, and I'm sorry"" with little tears in my eyes I let out a gentle smile (this would probably be the last time I see him). I few days have passed since then and I've taken it upon myself to voluntarily refuse water and food in hopes of having a death im comfortable with.

I know that ill miss everyone I'm close with and I know that once im gone, that's it, there's nothing after but i think im ready for that nothing. The only hopes I have is that when I go something will change in what was my life"	1
Theres no reason why I shouldn't end it.I feel like I posted here before but my mind and memory has been so fucked up the past year I can't remember shit. I'm 26 In  a few months and I barely have any friends, the ones I do I rarely ever get to see. I got fired a month ago because I blew up on management for the constant shitty treatment they gave me every day and so they kicked me out and banned me from the property and since then I havent found a full time job no matter how hard I try. I never had a proper girlfriend so I dont even know what it's like to hold hands with a female while other people my age i went to school with have went to college, found great jobs, and started a family. My health has also deteriorated as I have untreated obstructive sleep apnea so I cant breathe for shit when I try to sleep so I'm constantly tired even if I sleep for 12 hours(usually consists of me waking up briefly every 2 or so hours). I cant fucking afford the machine to help because my moms insurance doesnt cover it all (cant even afford my own health insurance or car insurance I have to rely on my mom for everything because of how much a failure I am). I have severe social anxiety so anything I try to do that involves going somewhere or doing something new I get so nervous and freak out I usually just go back home and sit in my room. The last time I truly remember being happy was when I was a kid. Its only gone downhill since I graduated high school 8 years ago. The only thing that even makes me slightly smile anymore is my dog, but with her health (over weight blind diabetic and being a pug has respiratory issues) she wont be around forever since she has all that and is already 10. Sometime I just lay in bed like I am now typing this wondering what would happen if i just pull the trigger without thinking twice.  I dont think theres anything after death anyway and we all die someday so might as well get to the point. Hm.	1
Can someone talk to me I'm tired and can't sleep and I feel very lonely and sad &gt;!and horny!&lt;	2
life has been reaching a breaking point for mei don't know, man. i'm starting to feel pretty out of it. losing it. getting crazier and crazier. doing anything to numb down the thoughts. the future seems dark and hopeless. i don't want to live another 20 years like this, then 20 more, then 20 more... death seems like a much more viable option. 	1

"My ""life"" ended a long time agoI'm posting here because I'm for the most part done with living. Life has nothing to offer me. Never has. 

First, I'm going to describe myself so those who will be turned off by talking with someone like me will know up front.

I'm 5'3"", about 150, 55 years old, medium-brown skinned female, short small nose, a jutted jaw with thin lips, sunken eyes, a metal hip and cataracts. Face looks flat from the side and people have called me ""retard"" or ""Down syndrome"" because of it. I might actually have something wrong with me genetically. I've always had poor muscle tone. So there, I'm ugly, and on top of that, I'm probably a narcissist with schizoid affective disorder, have been hospitalized in medical and mental institutions more than 15 times. I was assaulted in one of the mental institutions. 

I have never stopped thinking of committing suicide. I think about it every single day, have done so since my early teens. I was almost successful back in 2011. Worst day ever for the entire world. I should have died then, at least.

Not one person on this earth is compatible with me. Several people have said to me, ""Don't nobody want you,"" and they have been right. Even the guy I was married to and divorced didn't like me for anything but as much money he could spend. I can't think of one family member with whom I've been close. I'm a burden to them all, and that number has always been around five or less.

So, for all of my life, I've been pushed off on people whose job it was to ""provide services"" to me. Now, even those people don't want the job.

So what's left?

The sooner I'm outta here, the less of a burden I will be, and the better off the world will be."	1

"Life has shit on me since the day I was born.My family is shit, the Third World country I live in is shit, my health is shot to pieces. Everything I touch crumbles to dust, Nothing ever works out, No romance. No friends. Unable to work full-time due to fucked-up health. 

My toxic family has always hated me and they're blaming me for my declining health. My psycho dad always threatened to kill me since I was a toddler. My mother doesn't give two fucks about me and never has. Instead she worships the abusive cunt she married.

When I was younger I was full of hope that my life would change. It did but not in the way I expected. IT GOT MUCH WORSE. My fucking disease is killing me. No cure. The universe has been mocking me and shitting on me since the day I was born. 

I realise now as I sit in agony that this world isn't meant for people like me. This cunty life will be ended this summer. I'm going to go on a nice holiday and then end it all. I just don't know how yet. Hanging seems like a good option. 

I can't wait to end this constant trauma-fest that has been my fucking life. My parents will be relieved that I'm gone. I've been the family Scapegoat forever so they'll get their wish when I disappear. Fuck those cunt parents who ruin their children's lives."	1
Nobody can ever be there for meAll of the people I trust just can't. I'm so overwhelmed by school and work and my newly destroyed relationship and I'm such a mess but nobody can help. God I just want this to be over. Everyone either doesn't care about me, or cares so much that it'll only make things worse to talk to them. I feel so afraid and lonely and lost I just can't handle it. It's been almost a year since my last suicide attempt but why not now? I just can't handle my current situation, and I can't do anything about it. Please just make it all end...	1
"A Substitute Teacher's View on False Accusations First off, I'm 27, so I'm definitely outside the intended audience here, but a thread from this sub came up on /r/all of someone very upset that their favorite teacher and mentor was getting fired unfairly. I wanted to chime in with some thoughts from my perspective as someone who's had the pleasure of substitute teaching over the course of a couple years in a bunch of different schools in California. 

I've certainly encountered students behaving extremely inappropriately, and I've even had a troubled student or two joke about reporting me for things they made up. It is, on a personal level, really icky and kinda scary, but you put on your blank face, remind them to focus on that math problem, and move on. Educators have a lot on their side. Often too much so. Staff is pretty fundamentally almost always going to side with teachers over students. It is not easy at all to get a teacher fired, or even to get a school to stop bringing in a particularly bad substitute. Furthermore, educators have it drilled into them how to behave appropriately with students, which includes keeping things public and keeping contact with students outside of school limited and professional. This is for the safety and wellbeing of everyone, and as long as a teacher is following standard practices and not straying off the path, it's very unlikely for any sort of false accusations to get them fired. 

If a teacher is getting fired, there's probably really strong evidence of utterly unacceptable behavior, and it's also likely a pattern of behavior. Anything less, and the default attitude of many people is that the person saying something is lying.  


In any case where the facts are in doubt, well, schools have a lot of reasons to prefer sweeping things under the rug. A fired teacher is a big deal, it makes waves. A broken hearted or troubled student being lectured to stop lying, just being ignored or patronized, or being sent off to a different school is all sadly normal. If a school is actually taking action on students' reports of harassment, there's probably a lot more to it than you might think, or than what you really have a right to know about.   


I get feeling defensive of favorite teachers. I can tell you that teachers appreciate it. But that feeling is from your experience with that teacher, and other students have their own experiences. Just as you show different sides of yourself with different people, that teacher may behave very differently with someone else. If they did do something horribly wrong to someone else, well if history class teaches anything it's meant to be that people are complicated and that even national heroes can also do monstrous things. Part of growing up is coming to terms with those things and not letting them make you suspect the worst of people.  


Speaking of which, do cabals of students conspire to fabricate evidence and successfully get teachers fired for funsies? I expect it's happened. Cabals of students have literally murdered people. But it is not **normal**. It is in fact very **rare**. If a teacher is fired at your school (for non-budget reasons), however great they were to you, they very likely stepped way out of line with someone else. And if they did that with one kid, they probably did it with others who didn't say anything.   


As serious as false accusations are, and they should never be made, real abuse is far more serious in the harm that it does. Please don't rush to judgement, especially not of your peers. It's okay to not have a strong opinion on something you've heard about second hand.   


If you have experienced someone behaving inappropriately towards you, please tell an adult that you trust, and/or take a leap of faith on someone who works for your school. All education staff are mandated reporters and you **will** find someone who will be on your side if you open up. If you're in California, students can file complaints on educator misconduct online here: [https://www.ctc.ca.gov/educator-discipline/public](https://www.ctc.ca.gov/educator-discipline/public)"	2
"Literally impossible for me to turn my life aroundI'm transgender. Been on hormones for 3 years almost.

I've worked out fashion choices, gotten good at makeup and have a good haircut and a so-so voice. But I can't pass to anyone. I'm just treated or assumed to be a femme gay guy no matter what I do. I regularly get stares, comments (made loud enough for me to hear), laughter, glares, sometimes slurs, sometimes people following me, passive-aggressively shitty service in most businesses I go to and taken advantage of guys who know that I'll sleep with them if they lie to me and tell me I'm pretty. Facial feminization surgery is $20k at least and with my shitty field choice I won't be making that any time soon. Plus, I suspect the surgery won't have that much effect on me as I've seen results and the changes are usually subtle i.e. pushing someone from andro to femme not from masculine to femme, so i'm fucked regardless. Also I'm sterile from the hormones. 

I know it's easy to tell people to just keep trucking and just keep going and to just not care what other people think, but let's be real if you were dehumanized every day no matter where you went your mental health would be pretty shitty too right? And this is in a liberal city so i don't have anywhere to escape to. What's even crueler is that i'm smart, that I'm qualified, that I'm  that I would definitely be happy with everything else if not for the one horrible thing ruining my life. 

I wish I hadn't opened this pandora's box. I can't go back and I can't go forward. Literally the one thing I want in my life, the thing I would give up everything else for is just impossible. Maybe some people have the mental fortitude to keep going but I don't think I'm one of them. "	1
"No Hope for TomorrowMidnight will strike soon, and it'll be tomorrow. Ah, tomorrow, what a terrible day. I wonder what will happen? The same old thing? Maybe the same old thing, but with more problems. Perhaps the same old thing with more problems that I have no money for.

Boy, oh boy. I wonder what will come the day after that. Christ, why should I bother. What's keeping me going anymore. I don't really know. Another day, another month, another year. All of it dragging on. All while I can barely remember them. 

What's going to change tomorrow? I win the lottery? I find my purpose in life? I meet the person who I would love for the rest of my life? It didn't happen for years, and I doubt it'll happen another several. Maybe world peace would happen! What a load.

Maybe, just maybe, something good will come, and it'll be absolutely wonderful. Then tomorrow will happen, and it's all gone. Nothing left, but fading memories. Back to the usual song and dance.

Look, I don't know what to tell you folks that you probably haven't heard before. I'm tired, I'm lonely, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not sure if I will.

One day, I'll make some bread, say my goodbyes, and this old fool will die a coward's death. Only then will tomorrow never come again."	1

"It would've been so easy so why didn't I?when I get really bad, I go for a drive. Blast music and try to clear my head and get myself together. But this time, I could see images of my self crashing into a ditch or a tree. It was so real and I wish I would have. I have no one to talk to about this, actually I have no one. period. 

so I'm just trying to sleep away most of my days and try to get through the next few days. "	1
Almost everything about the future makes it seem not worth itWhat do I have to look forward to when I get older? I have no friends, have zero social skills AKA zero chance at finding a partner or even just basic friends I feel genuinely attached to and also means my chances of getting a job are significantly reduced since I can barely talk to another human being, I have zero future in regards to my education since I lack motivation and direction, I don't have any chance at making myself worth anything to anyone I'll likely come into contact with. I'm ugly, have zero fashion sense, am generally physically below average. The only things I can reliably assume will be true are that I will probably end up getting kicked out at some point and that my physical health will only deteriorate from this point forward. The job I currently have is pretty taxing on my wrists, and my hearing is already suffering for no apparent reason. Why should I feel obligated to hang around? I'm not in a crisis, but killing myself a little after I turn 30 is looking extremely appealing. I know it sounds selfish, but I'd have literally nothing to live for at that point, so why continue to exist only to have my physical health take a turn for the worse until I die, working a job I'd likely hate, still wishing I had friends or anyone to share my life with to a reasonable extent. 	1
GoodbyeI'm going to buy a rope tomorrow and wait until Tuesday night to hang myself. I'm going to write a few suicide notes for my parents and wife. Hopefully it hurts my parents but I honestly doubt that it will. I'm completely done with this life and it can't be worse at least I'll be in a better place whether it's heaven or hell.	1
Fuck this year Just got news that my close friend is really sick and could die, and my other friend is in the ER due to a non-fatal but progressive disease. I haven’t been this scared in over a year. I know that she can survive, I know she’s strong, but it’s still fucking terrifying.	2
Life’s not worth it anymoreHi so today I decided that within the next week I will kill myself. I came to this choice after my best friend slept with the girl I love last night. This is not the only reason but it’s the one that finally broke me. I’m an unattractive guy. And my biggest fear is never finding someone to actually have a connection with. I had a connection once with a girl in highschool with me but she was very abusive. She like to cut me with knives because it gave her pleasure. I was in a relationship with her for four years until I went to college and that was 3 years ago. I have problems with girls because of this relationship and I never can find an outlet to voice my pain because I’m a guy and guys just can’t do that shit. At least that’s how I was raised. So you see with this last straw and everything else I just don’t feel like any of this is at all worth it anymore. Why live when for 3 years all I felt was pain/mistrust to people. So that’s why I decided to do this. I’m only typing this because I don’t want to leave behind a letter. That would ruin my parents 	1

"Just want you're opinion on how I'm feeling right now.For a while now I thought the nightmares and dreams I've been having were becoming more and more vivid but it was only recently that I've come to realize that it wasn't that they were becoming more vivid but rather my real life was becoming more dreamlike, drowsy and insignificant to me. Sometimes I dream of my home with all these extra corridors and rooms and doorways into other realms and I wake up and lay in bed for hours thinking about those places until I realize that they don't actually exist. Its not surprising, Everyday its the same thing, I wake up and just zone out until I have somewhere to be like school. Hours pass me by, often I can't even remember what I've done with the time, I'm there in my head thinking about my life and certain aspects, always thinking but never really there in the moment. I think my grasp of reality is fading, I have very little social contact with the rest of the world. Its like I'm watching my dull life as a movie now and not really living it. I don't have any friends and my family, though me and my brothers are close, seem to maintain an unspoken agreement that we should never talk about our emotions. 

My parents act like drones too, its like I don't even know who they are, all they do is watch TV all day and occasionally when times are tough they make it obvious that they hate this position their in with having spent their lives raising kids though it doesn't really bother me anymore I don't think I ever needed their acceptance I just hope they don't ever expect me to take care of them in their old age as I don't feel anything for them. Though no one wants to know as a child that their parent's are done actually caring for their children by the time they're born like they're just another item off the assembly line. As a child I always felt old, a thousand years old, not being able to relate to anyone my age, just watching and observing as if I didn't belong there at all.

I don't think I've ever felt love or cared for any other human in my life. For a short time me and this girl in high-school who I was good friends with were having sex without any actually relationship(she like weird guys and I filled the requirements) and then she suddenly cut it off, she thought I was boring and I suspect also because I was atrocious at sex. When me and her were having sex I couldn't help but think of how ridiculous the reality of the situation was, how bizarre and over romanticized the act of sex was and it was hindering my performance when all I wanted to do was enjoy myself. So the only person who has ever reached out to me for a relationship thinks I'm worthless, its left me feeling pretty unmotivated to look for a girlfriend. I look into peoples eyes and they don't seem human, they're cold and calculated and often even predictable and I often think of how little It would make a difference to me if I were the only human left on the planet, it actually seems like a really nice idea as I could go anywhere I want, I feel trapped now, this house is a cage.

Its not that I don't think people aren't capable of emotions like I am its just that I feel like I would have to wade through millions of them before I could find one that was actually sentient, everyone seems so sadistic, they always have someone they hate, I don't want to hate anyone and I don't understand why everyone wants to cause so much needless drama in their life. How can people who act so sadistic be human like I am? Sometimes I get so caught up with these pondering that I forget where I am, sometimes I get so made thinking about a point in my life when someone was being unfeeling and cruel to me that I punch the air as if I were really there thinking about how it doesn't matter if they get hurt because they can't possibly be human and want to cause such pain for no reason.

 I don't think I have the guts to finish myself off as its always been a reassuring feeling ever since I was a little boy, if I had a more convenient way like a gun or a pill I wouldn't hesitate. Perhaps this was more appropriate for /r/depression but I'm starting to feel like any means of release would be sufficient. I'm sorry this was so hastily and poorly written I just don't want to think of any of this for longer than I have to."	1
I wish I didn't have this unfulfilled longing for acceptance.And I hope it doesn't drive me to suicide.	1
What would you do if you were sentenced to life in prison? I’d honestly end it. No point in living in a place like prison. People don’t have “lives” in there. No one does anything truly worthwhile in a soulless hellhole like that. Where the only emotions that exist are hatred and despair. Why don’t they let people just choose to die in there? It’s eternal, endless, brutal torture.	2
i dont know why i want to do itqrthings arent even that bad i just dont want to live anymore im so mtired of everything i cant be happy m 	1
"ridiculousit's kind of funny how my boyfriend is texting me almost every hour when i kinda decided to give what he wanted. i told him he doesnt have time for me. that one time i was upset my mom was talking to her boyfriend, i told him about it but he didn't reply. btw he repeated tells me to tell him if something is bothering me but when i do tell him, he acts this way. and now ive finally made my resolution and planned every step to end everything does he suddenly acts like he cares.

i was not asking for anything. i just wanted to feel he was there. i wanted to talk to someone to keep my mind off things. in fact, i esp want someone when im lonely and suicidal. but my friends take hours to reply and no one understands how my mental health is affecting me. i can't trust anyone, not even my family who doesnt care about me.

im planning on breaking up with him and do what i have to do. i postponed this plan of mine to end myself bcos i dont want to hurt him, eventho things are very hard to deal with. but now, i finally decided to do it regardless of how he'll deal with it. i dont care about them. i reached out to them but they just dont care. they probably won't be affected of my passing.

uh im ranting idek if what i said made sense. im too sad to even care."	1

I don't understand it.I have been helping people cope with depression and suicidal thoughts for years and have helped a lot of them get back on their feet looking at a brighter day. But in reality I've been preventing them from doing exactly what I can't sum up the courage to do myself. I know I don't want to exist anymore. I just don't know why. I just need a reason to exist and I can't find one...	1
I am truly and utterly bored Ask meh somethin and I’ll answer it honestly. Everytime.	2
I had a dream where I was doing anal and when I woke up my asshole felt like it was a piece of bread dough that got streched. I'm now scared of sleeping at my grandmother's and confused on why it hurt when I woke up.	2
"Not sure how I feel.Life is getting hard, my girlfriend of 3 years left me with no reason given. She didn't want to try and work on things we never fought, so I don't know if I'm blind or stupid but I don't know why she left. The worst part is that's the good news without going too deep into detail I have a terminal disease and will be dead within a year at current estimates. She had no idea I am gonna die so that's not why she left. 

I feel life is getting overwhelming and I don't know where to turn. I will be falling asleep soon, I'm not going to kill myself but the thought keeps pushing into my thoughts."	1
"I've lingered on this sub for sometime nowI must admit, as I do for many things because of the fortunate circumstances I was born into and currently benefit from, that the majority of people experience far worse hardships. Even then, I cannot derive any comfort from that notion. For far too long I have lead myself to believe that I'd achieve something. That I will eventually take hold of my future, and aspire to do something meaningful. Can I say I've given it my all? No. Well, at the very least, have I felt satisfied in the few instances I've become invested in a certain task or something similar? No, whenever I've attempted something like maintaining a job, or increasing my GPA, I've always failed on some level. I've become so comfortable with keeping to myself that I struggle with relationships at the most basic level. I go into passive mode and just fall out of touch with those around me. Any job that requires effective communication like facing customers and putting on a smile, I flounder. I come off as some kind of socially inept weirdo on the fringe of being considered mentally handicapped. I've been openly mocked by past fellow employees, and I don't fault them for it. Some of the things I did and said would've caused me to possibly confer similar things if I were not the one perpetrating the bizarre behavior. I was so miserable when I worked at these places. A few times I wrote suicide notes while I was on break, although I never truly believed I'd follow through on anything. 
If I could succeed academically I'd probably be able to put this aside, as there might be hope I could get a job that would suit my personality. Of course, I wouldn't be relating this if I were, so what hope is there? I'm currently taking my third semester of classes at my local comm. college and I have something like a 2.6 GPA. I'm most likely going to have to drop the math class I'm taking and possibly another one if I don't complete an essay that needs to be turned in later today... I haven't any clue what I'd do if I took time off from school. I just needed to write this out for my own selfish reasons. Maybe one of you guys/gals can spare me some advice, but please don't feel obligated. "	1
I don’t have a fixation or anything at the moment, so I can’t motivate myself to do anything The only times I have the motivation to actually do anything are when I’m hyper-fixated on something, and I haven’t had anything particularly interest me enough to develop an obsession over so I’ve been bored out of mind and soul for a while	2

"Peace of MindOk. Deep breath.

Victim of years of abuse. Years. I won't go into specifics because some folks are sensitive to that. From 10-16 or so.

Met a girl, settled down and got married. Things were ok for a while, I started to change according to my wife. So I told her everything. Everything. She handled it as well as could be expected and suggested therapy. Which I took. I felt no better but took it anyways.

Spent years in therapy, with no change. Found out through people that several of my numerous abusers were dead, I felt sad.

I was depressed all the time, no answer, no help. Turned away from suicide lines in Can/US because they don't help straight white men, programs for lgbt, poc and youth, but not adult men. Not here to gripe, just matter of fact.

On a work trip, I had to pull over at a rest stop to make use of the facilities, and there was another man in there, pleasuring himself. I watched for a while before getting involved (stupidly) When it was over, it felt like a weight had lifted off of me. My depression cleared.

My wife noticed the change when I got home too. I didn't tell her why. We made love for the first time in over 6 months. I never lost attraction for her just function.

Cut to two weeks later, the depression is back. And with a vengeance. I'm out for a walk trying to clear my head and shake the darkness free in nature, when I stumble upon a group of men being intimate with each other. Again I watch from the sidelines, then again I join in. Then again I feel better.

I have zero attraction to any of these men, or really any other men for that matter.  It for some reason this action, this fulfillment of some sort of trauma bond, makes me feel better for short times.

I've always been safe about it, but I can't keep leading this double life. 

I've gone without that sort of contact for 4 weeks now and I'm staring very worryingly at firearms, ropes and such.

I can't tell her this, or my therapist. 

But I'm just about done

"Constant suicidal ideationSo this isn't a new problem, I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Every day I wake up and wish I had died in my sleep, sat at work ( like now ) I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, the same thoughts are there all day every day, driving to work or coming home, seeing my 'friends', doing fun stuff, etc.

It's just constant and never ending. I don't really have anything to be sad about or depressed about I just feel like I'm in mental pain all the bloody time.

A couple of years ago I was taken under the care of a mental health crisis team and finally got to see a psychiatrist, after a few assessments the conclusion was that I have a depressive personality disorder and that it's unlikely to respond to medication (of which I've tried a lot).

This has ultimately destroyed every aspect of my life. I lost the woman I love, the one person who somewhat soothed the pain, because I couldn't commit after 7 years together mostly because I felt like there was no point when I know I'm only going to kill myself. I really wanted to be with her, marry her and spend my life with her but this overwhelming desire to die to overroad everything else.

Despite all this I'm fairly successful in business, I'm what most people consider very well off, but really this just hides whats going on under the surface.

I do occasionally talk to people about how I'm feeling, but almost nobody actually understands what I'm saying because they've never felt what I feel. I can't really talk to my best friend/ex now because she's moved on to somebody new, he's a nice guy I think and I'm glad that she's with somebody who will look after her because obviously I never could in the long run.

I'm not really looking for help, I don't know what I'm looking for, I just spend so much time hiding how I feel I just wanted to put it out there. My head hurts and I just wish we had an off switch."	1

"""Why aren't you doing anything useful, son?"" Oh I wonder. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I physically can't because you and mum are being asshats dad.

My desk with my laptop on has now been buried for almost a week now. I'm not allowed to move anything off it without my mum because I ""would only make more of a mess to clear up later.""

This would have been solved last Friday, but my mum was ""too busy"" to keep her end of the agreement. This wouldn't have been an issue in the first place if my dad hadn't told my brother to ""clear up"".

Congratulations, you've made it my fault that I'm not allowed to get any work done."	2
